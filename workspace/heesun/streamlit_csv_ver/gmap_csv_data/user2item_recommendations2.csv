But it does seem to be built in a flood control basin, which may explain why they want no water in the park? Haha but this is a very good use of what would otherwise be wasted space. It does have a few challenges, there are a few mud holes or I should say overly wet sections, but I have never heard a dog complain about one of them, a lot of their humans do, but you never hear the dogs complain about it! So again it all depends on what your focus is? But there is ample room to run, there are ample squirrels and birds to chase, there are trees at one end, there are only a few benches, who says you need to sit down and dog parks anyway. And there are a few strategically placed poop bag dispensers and waste cans. But mostly there is just room to run!!! One other cool thing is, even though it is built down in a flood control Basin there is a very nice concrete ramp with handrail going all the way down. And then when you get to the bottom there is a large concrete area with seating. Unfortunately there is no parking other than street parking, so as long as you don't mind no water and parking on the street this is an incredible place for your dog!! And I learned something new at this park, I never knew there was an issue with people letting their little kids play on the dog stuff? Why else would they have to put on their dogs only?

I asked what the special was, what the really good food was to eat there. The waitress said that they're really known best for their breakfast and that the place was packed all morning long. Nonetheless she gave me a number of things that were...like all those foods that Swanson frozen dinners were trying to emulate, when they were trying to provide a simulacra of great homemade cooking, Salisbury steak London broil open-faced turkey sandwich...(I was originally planning to get a burger and they had burgers but it wasn't really a burger place.)

I decided to go with the enthusiastic recommendation of another waitress that I try the open face sandwich and it was magnificent. it reminded me of all those restaurants like the Tallyrand who try to sell home cooking but don't really quite pull it off, this place feels like my grandmother or some super competition version of my grandmother was in the kitchen cooking these brilliant dishes, things I normally wouldn't ask for but we're delighted to eat because they were delicious. I also had the ham and navy bean soup which was terrific.

the service was outstanding, the congeniality of the patrons was great, and it really felt like a place that was welcoming and homelike, which so many places try to pull off and fail. It's a place remarkable for achieving the goal of actually having home cooking in a restaurant.

We came here for some mid-shopping lunch.

I like Mendocino farms - lots of food options, unique, clearly very geared towards a healthy and sustainable diet/restaurant practice.

It was pretty crowded when we came but they got us our food in around 15-20 minutes which wasn‚Äôt too bad.

I will say that while the food is good, my only drawback is that the portion size is pretty small for the price. At least with my order - I got one of the sandwiches and while it was certainly delicious I ate it in less than 5 minutes and had to pick at my girlfriend‚Äôs salad. The salads on the other hand are ENORMOUS so you‚Äôre definitely getting a big meal with that option (although I would add maybe a little heavy on the quinoa - made the salad a bit too crunchy but that‚Äôs just my preference).

Original Use:	Laundry

Large marquee with a curving arrow at the top extending over the driveway. While all of the original lettering has been removed, the structure itself is iconic and sculptural. This property is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

Drive-up Building and Rear Additions - Constructed to create a place for the public to interface with the plant when bringing their own laundry and dry cleaning. One story high and irregular in plan, with a primary fa√ßade forming a concave curve to the street. Side facades (south and north) are flat, and the rear fa√ßade is L-shaped in plan. Horizontally striated metal fascia finishes the edge of the canopy. Large individual letters stand at the edge of the canopy, spelling, ‚ÄúDry Cleaning‚Äù. Wing wall extending form the north side screens the interior driveway court from public view.

Curving primary fa√ßade has eleven bays of windows with double doors in the third, seventh and eleventh bays from the north. Windows are composed of three horizontal, aluminum-frame sashes. Doors are wood with a central glass panel. Original light fixtures flank the doors, composed of a vertical glass tube which runs between two short metal cylinders of the same diameter as the tube. South end of the primary fa√ßade is punctuated by a tall Streamline Moderne pylon which carries signage, calls attention to the building from passing cars and defines the south end of the Royal Laundry complex.

Interior of the Drive-up Building has two main rooms. Front room is a reception area for customers to bring the laundry into the building. A second, back room is located behind (west) of the reception room. Walls are plastered and the floor is green, integrally colored concrete.

Primary fa√ßade forming a concave curve to the street and has aluminum windows. Horizontally striated metal fascia finishes the edge of the canopy. Wing wall extending form the north side screens the interior driveway court from public view.  South end of the primary fa√ßade is punctuated by a tall Streamline Moderne pylon which carries signage, calls attention to the building from passing cars and defines the south end of the Royal Laundry complex.

South Annex - building to the south of the Main Plant appears to have been constructed around 1930. Rectangular in plan, one story high, and covered by a flat roof surround by a parapet. Frame construction with a concrete foundation, and the exterior is finished in stucco. Divided into two parts both in the interior and on the exterior. South exterior of the east portion was remodeled in 1939 as part of the construction of the Drive-up Building to the south.  Interior of the Annex is a utilitarian space with flat, plastered ceiling and some frame partition walls built over time along the north side. Walls in the northwest corner of the front space are partially clad light green tile which may be from the period of significance.

1922 garage is the oldest building on the site, built five years before the construction of the new Main Plant. Framed in wood and clad in sheet metal on the sides and stucco on the front, where the front wall and parapet conceal a gambrel roof. Interior of the garage is a large, single-height space with a roof support by wood trusses. Ceiling is wood on the highest surface of the gambrel and corrugated metal on the sloping sides. System of pipes for fire protection is suspended from the ceiling. Interior of the front wall, which is stuccoed on the outside, has diagonal wood siding overlaid with vertical wood framing.",California,5.0,"Royal Laundry Drive-In, 1915 - Architect: Gordon B.

Nonetheless I would come back anytime.
The server was attentive.
My mom had taken me here for the croissants which are made fresh daily, but we were too late. Our server indicated they are usually gone by noon. We didn't get seated until 1pm.

We checked which places this was near and it turned out to be Freda's Wood-fired Pizza and the adjacent Topa Topa Brewery.

We decided we had to try this experience, which seemed reasonably safe with spacious outdoor picnic table seating. This building, called The Mark, and the adjacent outdoor eating area, is actually shared by 3 tenants currently: Freda's, Topa Topa Brewery and Rori's Artisanal Creamery.

We are a family of 3, including a pizza-loving 4-year-old. We first visited Freda's and ordered a 16"" New York Style Spinaci pizza, which has a thin, crispy crust and is baked in a pizza oven Toppings included spinach, mozzarella, provolone, EV olive oil, roasted onions and roasted whole garlic cloves. This was a delicious pizza! I love roasted garlic, but my wife picked most of hers off and gave them to me because she didn't feel they belonged on a pizza. What? is it Christmas already?

We also ordered a 12"" brick oven seasonal mushroom and white truffle oil pizza. This type is made in a brick oven, and you can definitely tell because, although the crust is also thin, you quickly pick up that charred, smokiness and flavor, and you can see the beautiful, light charring on the crust. Its toppings included mozzarella, parmesan, a ""seasonal"" mushroom, oregano and white truffle oil. If I had to guess, i would bet the mushroom is either a Porcini or a Chanterelles. The truffle oil added a great finishing flavor, and we did like this pizza more than the other one we ordered, although they were both delicious. The latter was more oily, but it was not off-putting in the least due to the great flavor.

We then waited outside, both for our pizza order and for a picnic table to become available. On busy days, you need to scan the tables to see which one is closest to paying and leaving. Then walk over and politely ask if they are on their way out. If they are, then hang around the table at a socially acceptable distance (pandemic or not) to keep other table hunters away. If you're too polite, you'll end up eating in your car or back home, which no one wants.

Once we secured our table, i walked into to Topa Topa, which has an outdoor patio where you can order, and I ordered a Casey's Kolsch and a Dos Topas lager.

The service was great, with the server dropping by multiple times to take plates and ask if we needed anything.

We loved our meal at Freda's, and i highly recommend it for your next artisan and delicious pizza experience.",California,4.4,Freda's Woodfired Kitchen,18,1,Food & Beverage,['Pizza Takeout' 'Catering food and drink supplier' 'Mobile caterer'],Camarillo,2021-05-31,4.403319361949067,5,34.216679899999995,-119.04356399999999

They are very popular & they are slammed so order ahead and be patient although they bang out so much food quickly.
The prices are very fair and you actually get a good amount of food for not a lot.

We had ordered Burritos a month before not knowing anything about the place and we instantly liked it and decided to come by to get a bigger order.
When we got there,
I was surprised they had an amazing ceviche bar where they make everything fresh and per order. It was soo good!
Also the tacos were a good size and excellent! The chicken quesadilla was fat and yummy. They also give you rice and beans with it as well.
The Tostada was surprisingly good. We ate it with salsa instead of chips.

The service was very good, our waitress, Rusty was very busy but she did her best to keep everyone of her customers happy.  The barman Tim was very personable.

The Clam Chowder is excellent! I had a side cup (served with delicious heated sourdough bread) with my Fish and Chips (Haddock or Cod.I had the Haddock as our waitress recommended it). The plate included a non-descript Coleslaw and tarter sauce;  I wouldn't recommend either. Fries were perfect on the otherhand, thick cut, golden brown and quite tasty.

I enjoyed a healthy taste of Cheryl's Shepard Pie (not sure that is what the Ship called it (basically mashed potato covering a bed of tasty beef).

I rate The Olde Ship as one of my top 10 for 2018 (I go out to a lot of restaurants... a whole lot).

We parked on the side street off of Harbor although I am told they have a small parking lot behind the restaurant. Fullerton and this area are (within 6 blocks to the main downtown area) are very nice loaded with special restaurants, shops and style.

The Olde Ship is well worth the money, about $$$ out of four. You will certainly enjoy this quaint artistic restaurant.

Hope this review helps you.

About 15-20 years ago he worked with two of my parents' dogs growing up via home visits/lessons (a Mini Dachshund and a St Bernard). So when I realized my 10 month old St Bernard mix was acting aggressive towards people after nipping at a neighbor, my parents referred me to Paul. First, we took our pup (Oliver) in for a consultation. The consultation was a little over an hour and he stayed until after 7pm to meet with us. Paul has a very direct style and was honest with us about what he saw in Oliver. While he's seen much, much, much worse, he said human aggression could be in his DNA and unfixable, but he was willing to spend  time with him and had some exercises he wanted to try. I was pretty defeated after the consultation because I was hoping he would say this is fixable. But this was our reality and I wasn't going to give up on our dog just yet. We ended up scheduling him for a day lesson with just Paul at k9 city, with a private lesson involving us afterwards. When we showed up at the end of the day for the private lesson, Oliver was acting different than I've ever seen. Paul told us about the day and said without us around, he was actually a really good dog. (Like I said, Paul is direct with his approach, so for a split second it hurt our feelings but woke us up at the same time). Turns out we ""dog parents"" were part of his problem... We were not direct/commanding enough with Oliver (babied him too much), therefore he felt the need to protect himself.  He had taken obedience classes for sit/stay/lay down etc but I had never seen him so focused on leash as he was when Paul had him. Paul told us that he was even able to use some of the neighbors around K9 City throughout the day to practice around strangers (they are apparently used to him coming around with dogs who have issues). Oliver was suddenly a working dog and we were coached how to keep him attentive to us, and how as dog parents we could show him we are ""pack leaders"". We left with some exercises that we implemented the next few weeks before booking our second private lesson to learn  ""come"" - so he will come to us no matter the distraction even off leash (dogs, people, food, animals, if he has something he shouldn't etc). Oliver's progress has been amazing - but no matter what Paul can do/teach he was adamant that it's up to the dog owner to follow through with the exercises. We have been diligent every day in practicing at least one of the exercises, and are still cautious with Oliver around new people, but have absolutely seen a change for the better in our dog. I definitely recommend at least a consultation if you have a dog with aggression or an issue. I re-homed a dog due a number of years ago due to dog-aggression with another one of my dogs and even though he has an amazing home and family now I am so sad that I didn't know about/take him to Paul.",California,4.8,K9 City,15,1,Service,['Dog trainer' 'Dog day care center' 'Pet groomer'],other,2021-06-30,4.770108183088783,1,33.484714499999995,-117.6731262

Food:
Had a bottle of Cabernet for dinner along with an Old Fashion Cocktail to start off the night.
*House made Potato Chips & Dip
*Crispy Chili Glazed Brussels Sprouts with pork belly, sesame and Cilantro
* Cheeseburger with Bacon
* Gnocchi & Braised Pork Sugo
My friends ordered other dishes and they enjoyed it.

The cheeseburger was okay.  Nothing really stood out to me.  The gnocchi was also just okay for me. Unfortunately, my dishes did not WOW me.  However, the potato chips and brussel sprouts were delicious.  I enjoyed every bite of the brussel sprouts.

(formerly Wrigley House, 1906-1911)
391 South Orange Grove Boulevard
Architect: George Lawrence Stimson
Primary Architectural Style: Italian Renaissance Revival
Secondary Architectural Style: Mediterranean Revival
Context:	Arts & Crafts Period
Original Owner: William Wrigley
Original Use:	Single Family Residence

Displays related to the Rose Bowl Game, Rose Queen and Royal Court, and Grand Marshals make up most of the d√©cor.  Guided tours allow visitors to see the 21-room Italian-Renaissance-style mansion designed and built by architect G. Lawrence Stimson and his father George W. Stimson. Well-versed in the organization‚Äôs history and details of the house, Tournament of Roses volunteer members from its Heritage Committee lead each tour.

Wrigley's retreat is seen by Americans across the country every New Year's Day in its role as Tournament House, the official headquarters of the Tournament of Roses, started by early Pasadena's pioneering boosters in 1890 to ""tell the world about our paradise.""

The Wrigley family decided to donate the mansion and its four-and-a-half-acre yard to the Tournament of Roses Association, to honor the city their parents loved so much. In a letter, Phillip K. Wrigley explained: ""The birth of the world famous Tournament of Roses took place across the street from this property more than 70 years ago. The donors believe it is in the public interest to provide a home for said association that will be a credit to the city of Pasadena in the years to come.""

The Tournament of Roses quickly moved into the 22-room Wrigley mansion, which became a ""bustling hive"" of tournament activity. Offices and conference rooms, where the parade and bowl game were planned, were installed on the ground floor. The upstairs bedrooms were turned into theme rooms, such as ""the queen's room"" that featured past queens' crowns. Appropriately, a public rose garden installed adjacent to the house featured more than 1,500 varieties of roses, camellias, and a famed Moreton Bay fig tree. Grand Marshals of the parade were entertained at glittering cocktail parties.

In 2000, the association began a massive two-year renovation of the Tournament House. Seventeen members of the Pasadena chapter of the American Society of Interior Designers were asked to redecorate a specific room in the house, using historic photos of the rooms for inspiration. The house's original hardwood floors were restored, and a hidden bathroom was discovered. An open garden balcony off the library was enclosed and turned into a solarium featuring a private bar.

Today, the Tournament House is open for weekly tours from February through August. And every New Year's Day, thousands still line Orange Grove Boulevard, enraptured by the floral floats that still promote the ""paradise"" Pasadena's Midwestern pioneers came there to celebrate.",California,5.0,Tournament of Roses Association,3,1,Corporate & Office,['Association or organization'],Orange,2020-03-06,5.1222285227336055,1,34.1391072,-118.1600833

The staff were very patient with explaining the rules and getting us comfortable with driving the go-karts. The adult karts do go faster than the kid ones, obviously. The kids, we were told, top out around 30mph, but adults go to 45 I think? And even then, that's only if you're on a straightaway.
You pay a $7 ""membership"" fee to get a card, then you can purchase how many races you want to do. 2 races were $40. They had multiple sizes for helmets, or you can bring your own. They call out your name when its your turn to race, and they assign you a car number. There's a digital board that shows the racing stats during the race, then you also get a fun printout at the end that shows your rank and how fast you were going each lap and compared to the other racers in your group.

I drank the juice of the day
The ricotta cheese on the brioche toast went so well together I wanted to try 3 more jams
The french toast was perfect and it was so yummy I used jam inside

I don‚Äôt know if my words will be strong enough to describe just how truly amazing our experience was tonight. Our server Jesse was busy and didn‚Äôt get to us right away. For that she was very apologetic. Her service was friendly and attentive, very welcoming. Something I have learned in my many years working in restaurants, a great server is an amazing asset.
Jesse brought us our drinks, chips with pur√©ed black beans and pickled jalape√±o with carrots. To drink I had Jamaica, it wasn‚Äôt overly sweet it was just right.
As far as the food goes. I went overboard and ordered chicharr√≥n with yucca, Pl√°tanos with black beans and crema, as well as an order of Tacos Dorados. My wife ordered a pupusa revuelta with an order of pl√°tanos with black beans and crema. My mother in law ordered a trio of tostadas (1 with pur√©ed black beans, 1 with salsa & 1 with guacamole) for all of us to share.

Everything was perfect!!! My chicharr√≥n and yuca fried to absolute perfection. The sweet plantains with the crema and savory black beans was absolutely perfect. My tacos dorados as well as the salsa tostada flavors were perfectly cooked and seasoned.

There's a counter you walk up to where you place your order and pay for and pick up your food and you can either eat in the dining Room or their nice small patio out front. As prices go in the area, they are not on the high side. But what they give you is a good, honest pizza.  I think the crust is excellent and when you get to the edge you are rewarded with a bread-like quality but the rest of the pie is very thin crusted.  A large pizza is $28 a super large is $31. They have a nice lunch special - a slice of pizza, a small salad and a fountain drink for $9.50.   They also have gelato which I found to be pretty good - excellent texture.

We have been here twice in June. Staff is friendly and accommodating. They provide you with costs before they do anything. They also help prioritize what treatments are necessary (must dos) when you may get overwhelmed and cannot make a decision.

Their fees are reasonable. Dr Nick took the time to explain what my dog had in person and via email. We will be back since my old girl has been diagnosed with chronic heart issues.

You are able to take your pet prescription (written Rx) to be fulfilled at Costco (pet meds) if you ask.

One of my favorite places to work during lockdown is the seating area outside Rick and Ann‚Äôs. I usually pretend that I‚Äôve just had an expensive game of tennis at the Claremont Hotel and am doing some Important Work before I hop into my hybrid SUV (sometimes it‚Äôs an imaginary Tesla). Other times, I put on a blond wig, baseball cap and shades and pretend that I‚Äôm Taylor Swift on a low profile retreat at the Claremont. I might sing or hum a little bit of Invisible String as a finishing touch to that completely plausible scenario. Seriously though, it‚Äôs a great place to hang out and there‚Äôs a very peaceful vibe ‚Äì so please don‚Äôt all turn up at once!

I originally used to get a coffee from Rick and Ann‚Äôs and a pastry and slice of pizza from Fourn√©e. After a while I realized that Rick and Ann‚Äôs pastries are pretty darn good too! Plus, they have a different selection every day, providing a nice change from the (admittedly awesome but 6000 calorie) chocolate almond croissants from Fourn√©e. I recommend R&A‚Äôs scones and muffins and also items like the pecan bar if you have an especially sweet tooth. Then I discovered the vegan burrito ‚Äì it‚Äôs $7.50 for one of the healthiest and tastiest burritos that I‚Äôve ever had ‚Äì packed with zucchini, potatoes, black beans and spinach.

There‚Äôs a lot of seating in that area ‚Äì both shady and sunny ‚Äì and free Wi-Fi from Peet‚Äôs if you need it. I‚Äôve also been to several work events that were catered by Rick and Ann‚Äôs and can vouch for their other dishes ‚Äì it‚Äôs hearty comfort food made with good ingredients.

I‚Äôm also giving the Rick and Ann‚Äôs 4/5 ‚Äúgreen stars‚Äù for social and environmental impact, based on this:

‚Ä¢	R&A‚Äôs have spent more than three decades making healthy food using local ingredients.
‚Ä¢	Reasonably good selection of vegetarian and vegan options (try the vegan burrito!)
‚Ä¢	They‚Äôre doing a good job at minimizing waste during lockdown. Cardboard containers and compostable utensils, if you need them (although you should be bringing your own utensils at this point, one year into lockdown).
‚Ä¢	When we‚Äôve had R&A catering, there‚Äôs also a good effort made to avoid unnecessary waste.
‚Ä¢	They really seem to treat the staff like family ‚Äì you can look up a story on Berkeleyside (Oct 2020) that describes R&A‚Äôs financial troubles ‚Äì like many businesses, it‚Äôs under serious financial strain during lockdown. Though it all, Ann has stood by her staff. Support them if you can ‚Äì get the pancakes if you‚Äôve never had them or stop by for a pastry. The pantry and pastry counter is open even outside of their regular mealtimes.

If you‚Äôre still not convinced, consider that Steph and Ayesha Curry were regulars!

It's not New York style, but I won't hold that against them: the crust is tasty and they don't overload it with cheese or sauce. It's nicely balanced and delicious.

Update: I went back again today. You know what? I'm now convinced that this is the best pizza in Mira Mesa (and probably among the top available in San Diego). Really good crust. Innovative (but not absurd) and delicious toppings. I tried the pesto and the special of the day, meatball -- both were excellent.

We tried their meatball appetizer -- 3 meatballs plus generous marinara sauce (they'll throw in a little pasta if you like). Delish!

Oh, and they're open for dine-in as well as takeout as of early June 2020: You can safely sit outside and enjoy your pizza.

If you don't know what that is, please look it up as there are over 80 participating museums, that give you stickers when you go there and there are actually prizes the more you go to.  It's a fun way to learn about museums.

The museums in the P2H program range in their grandiosity, from very small adobes to full scale art museums.  I was expecting the former, but we go much closer to the latter!  They're not fooling around here, and they're constantly growing and renovating.  They had quite an impressive visitor's center where you wait for the tour (complete with free coffee - a part of the history lesson of the community's prohibition ties).  If you get there early, you can enjoy the koi pond (with an impressive soft shell turtle among the large fish and other turtles) and graveyard.

There are two tours - The Workman House and the second house next door (that's name escapes me at the moment).  We only had time for the first tour (each is 45 minutes and we had a 5 year old with us), but it was very cool and informative.  The exhibits are kind of bare in comparison to other homestead museums, where there are more artifacts from the home - but I think there is much more of that in the second home that we missed.  AND there is a behind the scenes tour where they take you in the basement and second floor!  The best part... ALL of these tours are FREE!!!  That's right!  They even have a cute little gift shop that actually has interesting relevant items and toys that are reasonably priced!  So we got some old time candy sticks and a slide whistle because... why not?!?

I know this may be out of the way for many... but make a day trip out of it!  We visited here, The Puente Hills Mall (The Twin Pines Mall from Back To The Future!!! - Be sure to go inside and check out the Twin Pines Mall sign inside the mall!), The Hsi Lai Temple (SUPER cool place that is very welcoming to visitors), a tamale shaped building, the Armenian Martyrs Memorial and more!",California,4.7,Workman and Temple Family Homestead Museum,65,1,Other,['Museum' 'Historical landmark' 'Tourist attraction'],other,2019-04-08,4.7636542911855235,2,34.019296,-117.964682

Ingredients & condiments were in high quality..I experienced taste of great sea salt, fresh soy sauce and novel dried & crushed soy sauce powders, edible gold powders, caviars and some more both identified and unidentified condiments all in this single meal. I have no clue and actually, the lady who was serving my table denied it but I could feel the taste of truffle oil too. There were scents! Kind of a few oils and flavours of fruits, I guess!!‚ô•

Started with Miso soup followed by..
Special tuna & Toro, Albacore, Amaebi (shrimp), Salmon sashimi, A5 Miyazaki Wagyu, Fried shrimp, Japanese Anago, Japanese Scallop (don't remember the exact order) and some for twice. All were amazing and this place has just become one of my top sushi restaurants. As for the fried shrimp, even the long antenal flagellum (??) tasted crispy and edible like biscuit. There was only one piece of Amaebi available for me this time. Of course, the A5 wagyu (sushi) melted in my mouth. Lastly, soy sauce and wasabi might not be necessary for their sushi but I still enjoyed this and that. Gingers tasted sweet.

As a dessert, I had peach flavored sorbet. No exception! Very delicious. Overall, I was really happy to enjoy their amazing sushi. The price seems to be based on the fluctuant market price so it is not and will not be predictable. Kindly, the lady explained everything for me each dish as per my request.

The battery will probably die in about a year. Will have it changed at next service. Price is comparable with AAA.
Also had the F-150 in for oil change two days later. Again phenomenal service.
July 2019 ~ Oil change and rear suspension recall. Required FEA too. Left the car, went on vacation. Came  back and all done. BUT the car is a bird poop magnet that works in Fullerton as well at home. :)

Oil change. Done quickly. On time. No upsell. I wasn't Jiffy Lubed. Looked up recalls and advised. Ordered a part for install next day. Great service, great people and fair prices.

The oil change was on Monday. Tuesday the parts department called to say that the door panel was in. (There was a quarter sized delamination in the arm rest.) I was transferred to a service advisor and set up an appointment to have the panel replaced on Wednesday. I arrived at 2 and was on my way by 3.

This is one of those places that should get a rating of ten stars on a scale from one to five. Yeah, they are that good for both service and sales.

Again, in for service and battery. New bank card wouldn't work. Nothing wrong with the card just their new terminal. ""Figure out what is wrong and come back and pay us."" It was like $200.  Never heard of a car dealer doing that.

All taken care of. I know it is an oxymoron, but this car dealership is honest. Best people in the world.",California,4.7,McCoy & Mills Ford,774,1,Other,['Ford dealer'],Fullerton,2020-08-12,4.765037897936875,1,33.869961499999995,-117.9376944

- The sodduk sodduk are the Korean sausages and rice cake skewers. The rice cake is crispy and chewy covering in this sweet and spicy sauce that goes well together. I think the spice was perfect and not overwhelming at all. Delicious!
- The Dduk Bok Gi (sauteed rice cakes in spicy sauce) was simple yet delicious. You can get it spicier if prefer.
- For the chicken wings, I got the half and half option with the original and galbi sauce. The menu is pretty focus on wings with different flavors, but the original was pretty good to me. It comes with potatoes and pickled radish which is perfect to go with fried food. Galbi sauce doesn‚Äôt taste like how it is on the short ribs, but my brother and I love it.

Lit is a 7.2 pct alcohol IPA. They have a 9.8 I think as well.
The Headspace is fantastic and their most popular IPA I think.

This is a small family run business and run by Trevor and his lovely wife and the brewmaster! That‚Äôs it! I lived in the building and passed by it while it was being built and finally decided to try it and support our local businesses.

Dedicated to the life,times and service of The 40th President of The United States of America,Ronald Wilson Reagan!
The experience at The Reagan Ranch and Young Americans Center was terrific and in the center is a vast historical collection of memoribilia from President Reagans and wife,Nancy Reagans, life-such as pictures,speeches,books,his ranch Jeep vehicle and an actual historical section of the""Mr Gorbachev Tear Down this Wall"" Berlin Wall that was one of President Reagan's greatest accomplishments-the start of the  dismantling the former oppresive Soviet Union and the formerly known USSR communist regime.
One the most famous US Presidents in history,Ronald Reagan was a true heroes,patriot and believer in The USA and democracy.
This is a must see in Santa Barbara or in addition to seeing the world famous-Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley,California.There is plenty of free parking and lots to see and learn about our country,its values,and President Ronald Reagan's life as a great American and a contributor to what truly makes The USA and its democracy the great country that it is .

TIP 1: DOWNLOAD THE APP. Aside from making purchasing/cancelling EASY, it automatically enrolls you in their FREE Alamo Victory Rewards program AND makes scrolling the programming/offerings more pleasant. From mainstream blockbusters to MOVIE PARTIES, they have so much to offer.

PARKING: They validate if you park in THE BLOC parking. $2.50 for under 2hrs and $4 for 3hrs. Sometimes at night I park on the street so that I can do a double-feature and not worry. And taking the Metro is even more convenient... as an exit in 7th (Red Line) is connected to the complex.

FOOD: I'm vegetarian so my faves are the: Crispy Cauliflower w/vegan ranch and their Beyond Burger. The french fries are great (more like potato slices curled) and the bottomless popcorn is never a bad idea.

Excerpt from Eat the World Los Angeles:
It may not seem like it, but much of the enjoyment of a shuco comes from the toasting of the bun. On the grill you can get some nice char and really good crisp. They also grill up a nice mild pepper with each order that can be consumed as desired. The biggest difference between most hot dogs is that they will chop up the salchicha. If you order a mixto (salchicha, longaniza, carne asada), they all mingle on top of a bed of guacamole and then are smothered with cabbage, cilantro, onions, ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise.

Original review...
Depending on your needs, for the size of the city this park is incredible. It is by far the definite favorite of most people in this area that I have had the pleasure of speaking with in the park. Having been to most of them myself, I would say it definitely ranks in the top two or three as long as you're not counting Ocean Beach or Fiesta Island. It has a very nice walking path around the outside edge that has elevation changes that has no steps, which for some of us makes it much nicer. The fencing is very nice, it is a heavy wood post and cross beams with black mesh fence. For some, the most important thing is the bathrooms are right by the dog park!! Google Maps doesn't lead you to the right place because the dog park is actually all the way on the back side of the park. There is a nice little path that walks you in and once you get down to where you see the paw prints on the ground and the bathroom the dog park is just right around the corner. I took some pictures from the entryway also so you know what to look for when you're driving around trying to find the dog park. But it is well worth the walk and the frustration of trying to find the right parking spot",California,4.7,Encinitas Dog Park,348,1,Nature & Outdoor,['Dog park' 'Park'],other,2021-05-16,4.825203751414285,1,33.0319465,-117.2831796

It‚Äôs been over a year since my last visit and I would still rate it 5 stars based on my Sunday brunch visit (had Lonsilog - garlic rice bowl with housemade  Filipino pork sausage, fried egg, veggies).

For health reasons, I‚Äôm not interested in the cheaper Filipino places, which use lesser ingredients and are heavily seasoned.

LASA uses quality ingredients and the execution is very good with balanced flavors. I‚Äôm definitely a fan and look forward to revisiting.

================================LASA has been on my ‚Äúmust try‚Äù list for quite some time since a serious gourmand friend of mine highly recommended it. I went with another friend I dine out with on a regular basis and we were both really happy with our DineLA meal and look forward to coming back. Upscale modern Filipino cuisine served at a level of high execution, but without pretentiousness by the kitchen and service was down to earth yet attentive. Beer and wine list is small, but good selections, which go well with the food.

We choose this restaurant because we wanted to gamble after dinner.
We made reservations online and boo they only had outdoor seating available. The wait for an indoor table would have been about an hour.

We sat outside and luckily there are heaters. It got cold only when the wind blew. Other than that it was nice.

Our server was Dana. She was nice and we appreciated the kind birthday gesture since my friends and I were celebrating our birthdays.

Food:
Complimentary Bread
Filet with Lobster Tail
New York Steak (my friend)
Asparagus
Steak with Sacallop

In fact the majority of the olive oils and the store are composed of a majority of canola oil and only approximately 10 to 15% olive oil. Another really cool aspect of the olive oil Farm in Ojai is that big house a great Tasting Room. Their Tasting Room has olive oil blends and balsamic vinegar blends that are OMG good!

Always excited to try goods from a new bakery, I picked up a loaf, tucked it under my arm, and ducked and dived along a socially distant path to the checkout. Actually it was almost the only loaf of bread left in the entire store, so I feel double-blessed to have found it. The Loaf: spelt walnut, weighing in at an impressive 910 grams and costing $7.69 at Monterey Market ‚Äì bear in mind that it‚Äôs almost three times the weight of a 12 oz Semifreddies loaf. The Bakery: As Kneaded Bakery (AKB) in San Leandro, recently picked by Sunset magazine as one of the 23 best bakeries in the West and recently listed as one of the top 100 bakeries in America by Food & Wine magazine. I‚Äôve started to gravitate towards walnut bread and have found a few that are very good ‚Äì most notably the sourdough levain with walnuts from Fourn√©e Bakery. I got a sense from the nicely designed paper bag that the As Kneaded loaf was also going to be good. It was. It had a nice crust that was, for lack of a more accurate word, crusty, but not too charred or tough. It had a good texture inside too ‚Äì plenty of holes but it held together after being loaded with avocado and tomato. I think my liking for the bread crept up on me because I had it for breakfast (one slice with avocado and tomato, the other with banana and salt) and then for lunch decided to have the exact same thing! Lockdown life, eh? By the way, try the banana and salt combo ‚Äì it‚Äôs really good on a hearty bread like this one and it may sound pedestrian but the salt makes all the difference. One banana, one avocado, one small heirloom tomato + 4 slices of spelt walnut = two of my meals covered.

Along with the regular rating, I think that the As Kneaded deserves 4/5 Green Stars for social and environmental impact, based on these factors:
‚Ä¢	AKB is a woman-owned business and also wants to support other woman-owned businesses
‚Ä¢	Providing good bread to the residents of San Leandro, where good bakeries were scarce before AKB came along
‚Ä¢	Their main flour is not organic but most of the other flours (whole spelt, whole wheat, rye) are organic
‚Ä¢	My loaf was made with local walnuts. Could do with a bit more info on sourcing in general
‚Ä¢	AKB recently ran a fundraiser for The East Oakland Collective to support racial and economic equality
‚Ä¢	Their bags are made from post-consumer recycled paper and printed with water-based inks.
‚Ä¢	Most of their breads are vegan and most of the rest of their menu is vegetarian.",California,4.9,As Kneaded Bakery,28,1,Food & Beverage,['Wholesale bakery'],San Leandro,2020-07-05,4.92790436802272,1,37.736182,-122.1533527

I was not a CBD believer, and very hesitant to try it.
When I first tried CBD oil and balm sometimes it would work and next time it wasn't of any help at all. So stop using both the cream and oil because I thought it doesn't work. And then a friend of mind convinced me to Visit and try Roma Leaf CBD. The CBD wellness center in Studio City.
I first tried the 1000 mg CBD balm, and then the 1000 mg CBD mint oil.
What a difference!!! WOW!!! A Truly Exceptional product.
All organic and natural, and get the same results and relief with each use. I can really say if not the best, Definitely one of the best CBD Balm and oil I have tried.
The ROMA LEAF CBD WELLNESS CENTER is located at the heart of Studio City next to Aroma Cafe, on Tujunga Ave. The staff here, are very knowledgeable, helpful, and not the kind to try and up-sale you.

It was sunny and we were defended from the cold street wind by the delicious hot green tea and the heat lamps. Really enjoyed the panfried rice noodle dish with seafood - it was deliciously crunchy. Their siomai ranks up there with the best I've had. The spice lovers really enjoyed the spicy wontons and argued that it was the best of the order. The chinese broccoli was cooked but still crunchy and the sauce/vegetable ratio was balanced. The Salt and Pepper Calamari wasn't over peppered and had a really great flavour. The hargow and shrimp rice noodle roll were perfectly steamed without being too gummy texture wise or pasty taste wise. I did not enjoy however the scallop dumpling but it seems like that might have been the outlier. The prices were reasonable too. Would definitely recommend.

It's cheap (~$3 for the ""little softee"")  and you get a generous amount. You also get a lot of toppings if you order one of their sundaes

Having rotating flavors is both a good and a bad thing. Good because you get to try new flavors. Bad because is you are craving your favorite flavor you might have to wait a long time.

I got the 2 egg breakdown with bacon and apple cinnamon pancakes and my husband got the factory omelet, that thing is huge and stuffed with so much meat and cheese.

It‚Äôs unclear when they will reopen but they are hoping visitors can return by 2022. I had the opportunity to tour the park with rangers to see some of the damage.

I've lived in the Bay all my life but this was my first time actually coming to Mezzo. It's a lot of fun - it toes the line of casual but a little nicer too. Not to make a crude comparison, but it goes for a Chipotle vibe, just trendier and more original.

This place has a TON of seating - it was way more spacious than I could have expected with a lot of fun outdoor seating areas and open-air indoor seating too. Very communal type of seating arrangement and it seemed like everyone was having a really good time. Even when it's crowded it's not difficult to find somewhere to sit.

The food here is really quite phenomenal, you can tell it's all naturally sourced and fresh-made when you order.

Architect: Roland Coate (architect)
*Katherine Bashford (landscape architect)
Primary Architectural Style: Monterey Revival
Context:	Historic Designed Gardens
Original Owner: John Barber
Original Use:	Single Family Residence

Symmetrical front-yard garden has a central pathway between the street and house flanked by lawn, shrubs and trees.  Perimeter wall and gates define the westerly property line.

Lovely Arroyo Boulevard Monterey Colonial Revival home was designed by the renowned architect, Roland E. Coate, in 1926 for John Edwin Barber. Architecturally significant home has been expanded and remodeled with careful attention to maintaining and restoring the original integrity of the house. Long brick walkway and lush gardens leading to the front of the house were originally designed by landscape architect, Katherine Bashford and have been artfully maintained by the current homeowners. Details of this beautiful home include solid wood doors, thick walls with bull-nosed thresholds, original light fixtures and many international and California contemporary works of art.

Katherine Emilie Bashford (1885‚Äì1953)
Education: Otis Institute, Los Angeles
Among the first women landscape architects in Southern California and in 1938 became the first woman to be elected ASLA chapter president.  Born in Arizona, she moved to California as a teenager and attended Pasadena‚Äôs Polytechnic High School. During the 1910s and 1920s, she traveled to Europe, where she studied gardens. Focusing on the design of estate gardens, Bashford opened her own practice in 1923, which she continued to operate until her retirement in 1943. In 1935, Bashford participated in the National Housing Exhibition in Los Angeles. The following year, Fred Barlow Jr., became a partner in her firm, resulting in a long-standing collaboration. In 1936, she was made a Fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects. In Pasadena, she designed the estate of Harry Bauer, Kenyon Reynolds, the John Barber House, and the Gaylord J.

She had some great vegan recommendations but we went with the Ahi Fries, Tonkotsu Ramen and Miso Ramen. The fries were some of the best cooked fries I've ever had, let alone the epicness on top: spicy tuna, a spicy mayo and perfect seasonings. My girlfriend got the Miso and it was rich and yet still light. My spicy Tonkotsu definitely needed more spice, but that may have also been due to not stirring it well enough, as there was a lump of something when I poured the leftovers in the to-go container. Regardless, I let them know it literally had no spice, they gave me more chili oil/paste and it was perfect. We also had two drinks and they were quite tasty.

I've had this restaurant bookmarked for years now and I'm glad we finally visited Market Restaurant.
Stopped by here during Restaurant Week.

We were greeted right as we walked in and the front hostess kindly opened the door and welcomed us.  What a great gesture.
Next, a few other ladies were at the podium and they too greeted us and we checked in.  They quickly sat us at our table.

The ambiance was very nice but I will say that the restaurant was a bit chilly so room temperature was not comfortable.  I even noticed that others had their jackets on.   Our server was very nice and detailed.  You can tell he loves his job and has passion for it.  Great service from the water till our dessert.

Both were delicious and I've eaten a lot of fish and chips over the years. The breading on the fish was crisp and flavorful without being too oily.  The oysters were large and perfectly prepared.  It was a bargin at around nine dollars.  My adult son's Cal. burger was just okay, he preferred my meal over his.

There were a lot of interesting and very affordable options on the menu.  The chicken strips with fries are a particularly great bargin.  The staff was friendly and the resturant was clean.  I will be back.

A week later I stopped back by and split three appetizers with my son.  Among them was an order of three deep fried scallops.  They were moist and very fresh, the best that I have ever had.

Update 01/08/19:
I have since been back to Stockton Grill 4 more times.  The fried seafood remains my favorite but the burger patties are not.  I am pretty certain that they are prefrozed and are lacking in juiciness and flavor.  The seasoned fries are great as are the shakes.  BTW, no reservations are required or even excepted.

Excerpt from Eat the World Los Angeles:
Their tofu thote ($12) is a winner, with a nice ladle of tamarind garlic sauce thrown on top. Burmese tofu is yellow because it is made with chickpea flour rather than soybean, which makes any dish using it take on this flavor as well rather than just the flavors of its other ingredients.

Thote dishes, all served room temperature and freshly mixed in front of you when ordered from vendors or restaurants in Myanmar, can be made with noodles as well.

On 90 degree hot days, the Chinese chicken salad & chicken okasan get sold out by 3:30 pm (on weekdays but close early on Sat & Sun). Get yours before 2 pm if you must have.

This is the best place to get Chinese Chicken Salad to go in hot summer days in Marin. At 5pm, you may call the restaurant first to find out if it‚Äôs sold out. During summer months, they sold 800+ salads and may not have ingredients left to make more in the kitchen. I heard they sell easily 5-600 boxes of CCS per a day during summer months.

Personally, Comforts Chinese Chicken Salad will be my deathbed meal as I crave for it every few weeks especially hot ""I don't want to cook"" summer days. The big box (looks like Chinese take out box) of CCS will suffice for 2 adults for dinner.
They have marinated tofu instead of chicken for the same salad for Vegetarian. We often get Tofu Chinese salad for friends practicing Halal or Vegetarian.
If anybody is allergic to sesame seeds or almond, you could ask one the staff to make those ingredients separately packaged for you, then they will make a new box of salad without those ingredients but on the side (in a ziplock bag) to take home.

The feeling is a blend between a wood-side town lodge and a Californian beach club. It feels traditional and modern at the same time.

The interior aside, let's talk about the bread and food. Cinnamon roll here is not your ""cinnamon roll"". It is a lump of chewy goodness drizzled with sweet cream chees. French toast isn't a ""toast"". It's a fluffy air-packed medium that melts away in your mouth. And I've never had such amazing potatoes... Not sure how they balanced the crispy and heartiness with perfect flavor. This place hit all the perfection with ever single dish. No complaints.

Now here was the issue: the server was reeking with snobbyness. She ignored (or forgot) our requests multiple times, whether it was hot sauce or a coffee refill. Didn't bother apologizing. And never checked-in with us. What was more odd was I felt like my table was the one that only suffered from this. Wasn't sure how that could be case because our table was on the path to all other tables. Even so, I cannot help but give 5 stars because it is just that good.

Tom, the owner, has had this shop over 20 years.  I was referred by a person that was a customer,  and I  can tell you, THIS ids the spot to change your windshield!!

Even though I came in as he was closing, he still fixed my car,  and charged me just a little more for emergency fee, to wait for me while I was driving there.

I really was in a bind and  needed my car in the morning for work.  I give him 10 ü•áout of 10 points for being a people-minded business, and 5 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êstars for excellent service and customer interaction.

We took our 4-month old lynx point kitten to be neutered, vaccinated, dewormed and microchipped for a total of $117! That would have easily been over $600 or $700 at a regular vet.

They charge $40 for neutering and $50 for spaying, and the feline IV and leukemia vaccinations were $11 each plus testing for FELV/FIV, which was $25. They charged $20 for the microchip surgery and $10 for deworming.

They are very organized, even in a pandemic. They have an easy-up set up outside, with a roped-off area for a line. For neutering and spaying, you make an appointment, then drop off your pet between 7 and 8:30 AM on the day of your appointment. When arrive, you wait in line, if there is one, and you're asked to fill out a short form. When a socially distant seat opens up inside, they invited you in and they check you in, confirm the services and take your pet. You're asked to return later that day between 3 and 4:30 PM to pick up your pet and pay for the services.

They are very strict about drop-off and pick-up times, and if you arrive for pick-up after 4:30, there is an additional $25 charge. If they have to care for your pet overnight due to a no-show for pick-up, there is an additional $100 charge.

Our kitty is alert and acting like nothing happened to him. That speaks to Mercy Crusade not over-medicating or using to much anesthesia for these little beings.

Overall, we had a very professional and worry-free experience, and I would highly recommend them for your pet care needs.",California,4.7,"Mercy Crusade Spay, Neuter & Wellness Clinic",433,1,Healthcare,['Veterinarian' 'Animal hospital' 'Livestock breeder'],other,2020-11-19,4.687782392188148,3,34.227073,-119.176144

They also add a snack bag filled with cucumbers and another bag with cooked onions and jalape√±os. The salsa was on point, but the green salsa (nice flavor) had a little bit of chunks of garlic and I bit into two of those, which is why I give them 4.5 stars (the last bite of burrito with green salsa and it left me with the garlic taste üò´).

During the search, Jason always answered our questions in a timely manner and booked our showings quickly. He was quick at writing offers. Three months into our search, the incredibly rare opportunity to buy the home next to our family arose, and Jason helped us land it!

This was fantastic for my 5 year old and I could have spent way more time there.  The best part is that it is FREE!!!  Technically by donation - but with zero pressure.

Full disclosure, my review of the Dog exhibit that is currently there would be entirely different... more like 2 stars.  I made the awful mistake of spending nearly $20 to do that, when I could have had a free day at the museum with all the other amazing things!  But we did get to see the Endeavor, if tickets for the Dog exhibit, so that was cool.  Oh!  You need to see the Body Works part!  There is a huge woman that is just strange.  The whole thing is a bit outdated - but the retro ness is super charming.  It evoked feelings of the Diet Coke of 1990's EPCOT Center.

For parents with small children:  There are MANY fun zones that are essentially science based play areas, closer to what you'd find at a play place.  So that is super helpful.  The highlight for us was definitely the aquarium section.  That was super cool.  But we really enjoyed all of it.  I can't wait to go back!

Parking is $12 (so it's not exactly a free day) - but totally worth the $12.  Drinks are expensive, so I'll bring my own next time.

One of the things I miss the most during lockdown is having a place to get coffee and work for a while ‚Äì yes, I know I‚Äôm not alone there ;) So I‚Äôm going to share my very favorite places to work during lockdown ‚Äì i.e., cafes that have a fair amount of outdoor seating (and preferably decent Wi-Fi coverage too). The Hudson Bay caf√© was a fairly regular haunt for me during normal times, and during lockdown it‚Äôs running pretty well with lots of safety precautions: Perspex screens, sanitizer, and a window counter if you don‚Äôt want to walk inside. Staff members were super-friendly as usual and there‚Äôs always good music playing (it‚Äôs faint outside, so I could just barely hear The Smiths and The Weeknd drifting out through the side door).

One thing to note is that the prices are very reasonable ‚Äì my veggie burrito cost an amazing $7 (or maybe $7.50) ‚Äì and it had guac in there too! And it was big! I also had an oat milk latte and a slice of pound cake and the whole tab was around $14. For comparison, I paid the same amount at another place this week for a coffee, cookie and plain croissant.

Lockdown Stats:
‚Ä¢	Seating: There are about 6 tables outside and chances are reasonable that you‚Äôll get a spot. If you‚Äôre stuck without a seat you can hang out on a bench outside the library across the street.
‚Ä¢	Bathroom: Another good thing about going to Hudson Bay to drink a lot of coffee ‚Äì the bathroom is open! It‚Äôs surprising how many caf√©s have no bathroom availability after selling you a big old cup of diuretic!
‚Ä¢	Hours: Note that they close at 5 pm at the moment, not 6, but they‚Äôll let you linger till maybe 5:30.
‚Ä¢	Weather: Hudson St. faces southwest, so it‚Äôs often pretty warm, even around closing time!
‚Ä¢	Budget: As mentioned above, Hudson Bay is one of the cheapest places around (esp. on College Ave.) to get lunch.

I‚Äôm also giving the Hudson Bay Caf√© 4/5 ‚Äúgreen stars‚Äù for social and environmental impact, based on this:
‚Ä¢	Very longstanding independent caf√© and community gathering spot.
‚Ä¢	Coffee beans come from McLaughlin roasters in Emeryville - another East Bay staple.
‚Ä¢	Some of McLaughlin‚Äôs coffee varieties are organic and most are bought directly from cooperatives or family farms that support communities.
‚Ä¢	It kind of goes without saying that plant-based milks are available ‚Äì and raw turbinado sugar too.
‚Ä¢	The menu is a bit more traditional but there are a few veggie and vegan options. I think they‚Äôll also make veggie/vegan mods to a menu item, if you ask, since everything is cooked to order.
‚Ä¢	There‚Äôs not a lot of info available about Hudson Bay‚Äôs sourcing of ingredients ‚Äì my feeling is that the owners want to keep things as unpretentious as possible. Since it‚Äôs lockdown I‚Äôm not going to bust their balls over it :D
‚Ä¢	Waste is minimized pretty well, even during lockdown when most places are loading on the plastic.

We love new places, and we especially love places where we can eat everything on the menu!

They greeted us at our table with a couple glasses of complimentary champagne as they saw on the reservation that we were celebrating. That was so sweet and thoughtful!

Everything we ate was beautifully presented and tasted really really good. I started with the Wooden Nickel cocktail. They said this was their version of a Manhattan and it tasted a lot like a really good Old Fashioned to me with a happy cherry surprise waiting for me in the martini glass it was served in.

I also had the chilled cucumber melon soup which was really refreshing, and thick too‚Ä¶it was kind of like drinking foam and it had a lovely melon ambience.

My wife enjoyed the Summer Minestrone Soup she ordered. The couscous in it gave it a nice heartiness complimenting the very present tomato taste.

I also have the truffle potatoes which were wonderfully crispy with a delightful truffle flavor. These were perfectly cooked allowing me to enjoy the softness of the potato on the inside as well as the crispiness on the out, and it was topped with a ‚Äúparmesan cheese‚Äù-like substance which was the most authentically vegan parmesan I‚Äôve ever had.

For my main, I had the Italian ‚Äúsausage‚Äù (soy and potatoes based -  and gluten-free!) It was served with peppers, onions and a tomato sauce which I thought was very tasty though there wasn‚Äôt a lot of flavor in the sausage itself.

My wife had The roasted eggplant which was a large and impressive looking half of an eggplant dish covered with a tahini that was spicier than she wife wanted (It didn‚Äôt say anything about spicy on the menu though other menu items did.) They were also nice enough to not include the breadcrumbs to keep it gluten-free for her.

We also shared the Gigante Beans‚Ä¶which were truly GIGANTE‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not always a fun of large beans like this but these were delicious and possibly my favorite savory flavored item that we tried.

We enjoyed everything though wife did feel that the meal overall was a little richer than she expected or necessarily wanted, but all the flavors were just right.

We did succumb to the waiter‚Äôs temptation and had the cast-iron corn bread dessert. This was downright amazing with a moist and delicious cornbread, topped with roasted brown sugar peaches, with a fantastic vegan vanilla ice cream on the side that was sitting in a little bed of crispy cornmeal. This was indulgent, flavorful and awesome.

Our wandering eyes also were salivating at everything we didn‚Äôt order but we saw head out to other tables‚Ä¶the artichoke oysters are definitely in our future.

This ascendant San Diego taco stand offers a streamlined menu consisting of just three options: chicharr√≥n (pork rind and beans - $3), frijoles (beans and cheese - $2), and carne con papas (a pleasant pur√©e of shredded beef brisket and potatoes - $2.50). El Rey Tacos a Vapor's corn tortillas are dipped in chili-infused oil, stuffed with one of the aforementioned guisados and then steamed so that both the damp tortilla and its savory filling form a harmonious union of earthy masa and spicy stew. The tacos are finished with fresh onions, shredded lettuce, marinated carrots, fresh-pickled jalape√±os, and a fiery salsa roja.

Fernando Sepulveda, who co-owns El Rey Tacos a Vapor with his wife Liliana, explained to me that his family has been selling tacos al vapor made this exact same way across the border for the past 60 years. His grandparents, Simon and Carmelita Rodr√≠guez, settled in Baja after moving from their home state of Michoac√°n. They began operating taco carts all over downtown Tijuana under the name of El Venadito Tacos a Vapor. Their brilliant family recipes have now migrated northward once again via El Rey Tacos a Vapor.

Depending on where you are, tacos al vapor are also called tacos de canasta, tacos sudados, tacos tuxpe√±os, or basket tacos. Choosing how you're going to refer to them is easy compared to finding anyone else in San Diego to prepare them for you. Los Angeles literally has dozens of places that serve tacos in this style but, before El Rey Tacos a Vapor, I've solely known Ranas in Spring Valley to serve steamed tacos locally, and only as an off-menu special.

This is why I was thrilled when El Rey Tacos a Vapor began surfacing on my Instagram feed over the past several weeks, even though (as always) I'm late to the party. El Rey may not have had a Yelp presence prior to a few minutes ago, but they've been around since August 2019, frequently popping up at Del Barrio Market in Barrio Logan and downtown Chula Vista. For the last month, they've been parked in the BLVD Court in University Heights as a guest of Tacos La Mezcla every Taco Tuesday. Wherever they are, my advice is to get there early, as they sell out sooner than their closing time. Once you taste their product, you'll understand why.",California,4.8,El Rey Tacos a Vapor,3,1,Food & Beverage,['Restaurant'],San Diego,2020-09-28,4.8183884405097,4,32.755760599999995,-117.1422384

Since its opening on November 9, 2001, it has been the venue of the annual Academy Awards ceremony. It is adjacent to the TCL Chinese Theatre and the El Capitan Theatre nearby on Hollywood Boulevard.

The theater was designed by David Rockwell of the Rockwell Group, with Theatre Projects Consultants, specifically with the Oscar ceremonies in mind. Though the stage is one of the largest in the United States‚Äîroughly tied with the Edward C. Elliott Hall of Music at Purdue University‚Äîmeasuring 113 ft (34 m) wide and 60 ft (18 m) deep, its seating capacity is only about half the Hall of Music's, accommodating 3,332 people.

The result of astute planning and technical design, the auditorium is particularly successful as a venue for televised theatrical performance (improving production values for American Idol and the Academy Awards). The architectural team consulted extensively with leading production personnel in Hollywood, achieving a highly functional cable infrastructure, with an underground cable bunker that crosses under the theater to truck locations on adjacent streets. Power is also substantial and accessible. The theater has a unique Rockwell-designed cockpit in the orchestra seating area for camera, sound, and stage management.

The hall from the front entrance to the grand stairway (leading up to the theater) is flanked by storefronts, as well as Art Deco columns displaying the names of past recipients of the Academy Award for Best Picture, with blank spaces left for future Best Picture winners, well into the 21st century. Currently the columns are set for Best Picture up to 2071. In a fashion reminiscent of Hollywood movie-making, the building is dressed before the Academy Awards ceremony, sometimes with a different sign on its facade, red drapery to hide its storefronts, and the famous red carpet running up its grand stairway.

The theatre is rented to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for weeks before Oscar night. Having hosted the awards ceremony annually since 2002, the theater is best known for this event. During the rest of the year, it hosts numerous live concerts, awards shows, symphony performances, and other events.

The theatre was sponsored, until February 2012, by the Eastman Kodak Company, which paid $75 million for naming rights to the building. In early 2012, Eastman Kodak filed for bankruptcy protection, thus ending its naming-rights deal. Then the theater's name was temporarily changed to the Hollywood and Highland Center at the suggestion of the venue's landlord. On May 1, 2012, it was announced that the venue would be renamed the Dolby Theatre, after Dolby Laboratories signed a 20-year naming-rights deal. Dolby updated the sound system first by installing Dolby Atmos. The company plans to continue updating the auditorium with newer technologies as they become available.

From September 2011 until early 2013, the venue was home to the permanent Los Angeles Cirque du Soleil show Iris, an acrobatic journey through the world of cinema, featuring an original score by Danny Elfman. The show made significant changes to the theater, including adding lifts deep under the original floor. It was announced on November 29, 2012, that Iris would close on January 19, 2013, after only two seasons, due to lack of profit. After hosting the Academy Awards on February 24, 2013, the theater reopened for touring acts and headliners.

As of 2016, the theater hosts the live shows of America's Got Talent.

The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because our room did not have a working faucet inside the bathtub. The shower lever did not want to go down and the faucet leaked and dripped. I hope they get it fixed.

The meat is also unlimited, but there is a limit to the amount that an individual can eat.. There are quite a lot of vegetables alone. The meat quality is really good. The taste is good because you can feel various and three-dimensional tastes depending on the type of meat. Personally, I feel that the oily USDA Prime Beef Belly is the most delicious. When considering quantity and quality at the same time, the cost-effectiveness also feels great. Spicy seafood broth is always delicious. Ramen is the best match for it, but since I was full, I replaced it with udon this time.

Most of all, you will have a steamed indoor meal in a very short time. The ice sikhye came out for dessert, and it was very good, and the most appropriate expression overall is'Cho 5'. The store is neat and space is spacious.

I think thats the combo number two which is great because their menu is pretty small making it easier and faster for me to select.

The food averaged at 4, 4.5 stars for us from a taste perspective. For the price it tasted good, just not exceptional. It all looked beautiful so 5 stars for presentation, but again, just seemed to not get me to the 5 stars. The roasted bone marrow bruschetta was delicious but they didn't have enough crostini for the toppings, the edamame was great with the truffle oil but wasn't a great value at $16. The pork belly yakitori seemed to be unevenly grilled so the fatty parts were a little undercooked while the meat itself was a little dry. The wagyu beef with garlic yakitori was much better. The hibachi pineapple fried rice was one of the highlights for us. The 6 year old loved it and they were able to accommodate for egg allergies. We dug out the rest of the pineapple after eating all the rice so it was a little dessert too. The Ishi Yaki cooking stone with American wagyu was delicious and enough to share for 2 people although 1 person could eat it all if they didn't order anything else. If this was all we ordered it would have been 5 stars. The spicy tuna crispy rice for a thumbs down from our party as the sweet sauce was over powering and not disclosed on the menu so that brought our rating down by a lot. For dessert we ordered the chocolate drama and shared it... It could have used some whipped cream or more berries - something to cut all the chocolate sweetness to it but perhaps that was intentional for the drama!

Then I remembered it's the beginning of the labor Day weekend, and driving on the freeway through downtown is a
terrible idea.

then was stunned to see much closer to me, that there was a oaxacan place in East LA, right across from the Malabar branch of the public library, no less. So far, so convenient, so I looked at the menu and got completely confused and then extremely excited by the fusion offered here -- Lebanese and Oaxacan. I could eat chicken shawarma all the time if I could get away with it and here's a place mixing it up and putting it in a taco.  my head exploded and I got in the car.

this place has a great story of which you can read in any of the many accounts that are so easy to find on the internet. I ordered a mix of two chicken shwerma tacos and two vegan tacos, one with cauliflower and the other with felafel. The shwerma tacos had a sort of cotija sauce and tahini and to be honest were not as good as the vegan tacos, which  were very good
.. . With the shwerma, something about the mix of the two sauces on the shwerma didn't quite work and overwhelms the actual marinade of the shwerma. I am guessing that a burrito version of this would be better balanced, and I'm Keen to try.

I  wanted to try something with cactus but I didn't see any on offer, and I'd read about some chorizo dish that wasn't on the menu that I should have asked for. I did order the cauliflower tabouli para llevar, along with the oaxacan hummus, which had a black bean base.

I've always wanted to like tabbouleh but it never has worked out for me. The very best tabbouleh I've ever had, even that I could  take or leave and wouldn't order more. it's sort of what you order when you want the most healthy thing to try to balance out all the heavy things, and there's not a shirazi salad on the menu.

I'm happy to report that the cauliflower tabbouleh and how it is made by these two geniuses have fixed whatever problem I had with tabbouleh, because this tabouli is very tasty.

But the true star was the oaxacan hummus, which was the best of all the items I ordered. It's some of the most outstanding hummus I've ever had. I ate it all in one sitting without much embarrassment.

it was an extremely hot day and unfortunately the only seats are outside, but hopefully you can see from the photographs is a little Oasis of color and style in the middle of a pretty grim strip mall.

They have their own brew to satisfy any taste, from a light, American-style lager, to pale ales and IPAs, to a medium-bodied Irish red, and the full-bodied stout. I ordered the Irish Red and my wife ordered the light lager, which were both very good.

They have an appetizer menu full of tots that will suit any taste: Thai, Mexican, or Italian. We had the garlic tots with parmesan, and they were delicious! I highly recommend them.

For our main meals, we ordered pizza--3, in fact: a vegetarian, a 3-cheese and a kids cheese. The crust was perfectly charred, chewey and thin, but without being soggy. They were generously sauced, and the vegetable toppings where perfectly tender-crisp. This was unexpectedly good pizza! They had to have been made in a wood-fired oven to give that smokey flavor to the crust. I thought the pizzas were a single serving each, but one pizza can feed two people. If you want leftovers, then go with a pizza per person.

Instead, I used a spacious room with two rooms and two bath rooms, a living room and a kitchen, and I was satisfied. The hotel has a private free parking space, so it was safe and there are a lot of rooms. Overall, the staff are not friendly (they have a lot of luggage for the children, but the 3rd floor is allocated without an elbe...), so I felt the desolation of the city.
Currently, Coronaro breakfast is a system that picks up all breakfasts and uses them in the room, but I think it's much better. Also, on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday evenings, a simple menu dinner was provided for free, so it was nice to have a hot meal. Please note that although it is a carpet, slippers are not provided.

I made reservations but I don't think that they where necessary since the large dining rooms were only half full.  The newly remodeled (according to the waitress) bar looked welcoming and modern.

Our waitress was young and had a lively, friendly personality (and a lot of arm tattoos).  We both had coffee, my friend ordered the rib plate off of the menu and I chose the smoked trout Eggs Benedict offered as a special.  Both were, in my opinion, about 20% overpriced based on what I've had at other restaurants.  My dish was very attractive as well as tasty.  The poached eggs were prepared perfectly, the trout was a little salty as was the pre-made Hollandaise sauce.  It came with some roasted new potatoes that could have been crispier and warmer. I can't say that the dish was worth the $18.99 but it was good.  My friend was pleased was her ribs but mentioned that, although they she expected them to be fatty, they pushed the limit of acceptably.  At over $19 they could have been better trimmed.  I would not normally be so picky but at these prices I expect better.  Before tip the bill was about $44 with only the coffee added to the entrees. Still, I would go back again.

Notes: Disabled parking and wheelchair accessible seating are both available.  There are many long tables that can accommodate large groups plus the children's menu seems to attract a lot of large families (a group with 10 children were seated next to us just as we were leaving) as well as large church groups.

Each dish was exceedingly delicious and service was also at topnotch. I also had novel taste experience and enjoyed their artistic food a lot. So, the dinining was extremely fun! Each plate was prepared so delicately in pursuit of excellence (in terms of decorations and mix of tastes). Yes, I could feel the culinary philosophy of the chefs.

Started with bread before a meal. Sweet and delicious! Btw, there were two types of bread they served limitlessly. And then an appetizer came out. It looked similar to the next menu in that food was layered in a small glass (consisted of caviar; not 100% sure). I tasted each layer separately and then all together. Tastes of different food items were mixed in excellence. Balance!

I chose Egg Caviar as the course #1. Soft poached egg was layered and topped with caviars. I had to use a spoon to eat it like the appetizer I had before. Exotic!

Next, I had Truffle Lobster Risotto. It's topped with shaved white truffles. The sauce was alfredo cream sauce. I felt like the food was just melted away in a blink of eyes in the mouth. 10/10 Tasty!

The main course of my selection was Snake River Farms Wagyu Beef Sirloin.  It came with bonemarrow sauce topped on it. Particularly, I was much amazed at the way they grilled the beef. Outer part of the beef was cooked crispy and I felt really good about it because its thickness and texture were also new and stunning. Salt and a novel sauce were also provided on the dish.

Finally, dessert tasted so good far beyond my expectations. I enjoyed sorbet a lot and some kinds of sweet tasting powders were put underneath it. Btw, I tried their 'Never Gonna Give You Up' cocktail. Satisfied‚ô° Personally thinking, it deserves its price of $300+ in total. Every single food tasted fresh and awesome.

Very casual and warm atmosphere inside, love the way it's done up. Few seats at a large community table and few tables outside as well.

Organic milk and great vegan options too. Few great gelato options, sorbets and coffee with great quality here!

I love me some pistachio gelato that is not easy to find but this place nailed it. I opted for the cone which was freshly made, crunchy and delicious. Hubby loved his afogato and we had a great time speaking in Italian to the owners.

Well located on a busy street like Shattuck and so close to the BART, makes this place ideal spot for that gelato on a hot day! They also have few table games for entertainment :)

They are Star certified, which I didn't really know the difference before going. Apparently it's a few more extra steps of quality and verifications that the government requires for them to officialy become star certified. When you get your registration renewal in the mail, every other year will require a Smog check, and sometimes that smog check needs to be star certified...usually if your vehicle is older, or known to be problematic, but sometimes it's just random luck, since they have to have a certain number of vehicles be star certified every year. Since this location's prices seemed on par with places that weren't star certified, i figured why not go to the one that's more legit! I went around 1pm on during the week and only had to wait maybe 10 minutes. Then when it was my turn, they had my car checked and paperwork done in less than 15. The guys working there were super friendly. Every one was wearing their masks. They had a coupon for $20 off on their website, so I definitely took advantage of that. My only complaint is on their website where the coupon is, they have a banner up that shows smog checks being $49.95, but when you get there in person it's $59.95....plus $8.25 for the certification, so out the door after the coupon I still paid close to $50...but that seems to be the average price for most other places too.",California,4.5,Smog Check Pros,38,1,Service,['Smog inspection station'],San Diego,2021-03-09,4.461392503462818,5,32.7744415,-117.20624509999999

Beginning in 1930, this site was used for motorless flight. Gliders were car-towed off the beach parallel to the 350-foot cliff so they could fly in the lift created by the wind flowing up the cliffs. In 1930, Charles Lindbergh soared along the cliffs of Torrey Pines and established the first gliding distance record. In 1936, Woody Brown launched and landed on top of the cliffs for the first ‚Äòtop landing‚Äô. In the late 1930‚Äôs, Hawley Bowlus, engineer and construction supervisor of the ‚ÄòSpirit of St. Louis‚Äô, began soaring the cliffs with his own sailplane designs.
The Gliderport was instrumental in the development of the first variometer (1939), which is a sensitive instrument used to determine the rate of climb or sink. The Zanoonia sailplane, built in 1939, was the first aircraft to use spoilers (air brakes) on the wings, which are still used by aircraft today. Bob Fronius invented the first aircraft parachute recovery system which was flight tested at the Gliderport in 1947. Flight operations at Torrey Pines were interrupted in 1941 when the Gliderport property became the Army's Camp Callan. Military operations were conducted here until the end of World War II.
In the late 1960‚Äôs the first radio-controlled model airplanes were designed and flown at the Gliderport. In 1970‚Äôs the first hang gliders flew over the bluffs of Torrey Pines. The Gliderport promoted paragliding during its infancy in the mid-1980‚Äôs. Today the Gliderport hosts radio-controlled model aircraft, hang gliders, and paragliders. Flying activities are 9:00AM to 5:00PM every day of the year, but depend on wind conditions. For ocean viewing, the parking lot is always open.
In 1992, Torrey Pines Gliderport was dedicated as a National Landmark of Soaring by the National Soaring Museum, and Historical Site No. 315 by the City of San Diego. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993 and expanded in 2008. It was designated an AMA Landmark Site by the Academy of Model Aeronautics in 2003.",California,4.7,Black's Beach,658,1,Nature & Outdoor,['Beach'],other,2021-03-25,4.82417565273853,2,32.887691499999995,-117.2529227

The place was busy, but we got seated right away. They currently offer both indoor and outdoor seating. The staff was all masked up, but i noticed that nobody was enforcing the patrons to wear their masks when walking past other tables. :/ I'd say maybe less than half of the people dining had their masks on when they were walking by. The menus are printed on large posters hanging on the wall, or there are little stands on each table that have a QR code you can scan to get the menu on your phone. The staff was really friendly. We got our drinks and food in a reasonable amount of time. Our waitress did come back and check in on us. :) The food looked amazing when it came! I got the Ol' Dubliner burger, which unfortunately came over cooked and to be honest quite flavorless. The corned beef on it was delicious though! I'd come back just to have a proper corned beef sandwich. My friend got the pub nachos, with a few modifications for minor allergies. Unfortunately one of the items not listed in the menu for the nachos was tomatoes, which I personally love on nachos! But she is mildly allergic (in fairness, she did not mention to our waitress that she had allergies). The pico did come on the side, so that was ok. The portions were decent for both meals. The last complaint was when we were done and ready to go, it took quite a while to finally get our check. It probably wouldn't have been as noticeable if it was a nice day out, but the sky started to turn gray and wind picked up. So since we had chosen outdoor dining, we were freezing and ready to go lol Our dishes had been cleared and our table empty for a while while multiple servers walked by.

The Grocery Outlet is able to sell food at a discount for various reasons ‚Äì it might be surplus stock, a product with old packaging, a new product that‚Äôs being tried out, or in some cases products that are slightly imperfect or getting close to their expiration dates. It has grown quite a following and the ‚ÄúGross Out‚Äù as it has affectionately nicknamed has become a destination for bargain hunting. I also enjoy shopping there because of the unpredictability of what I might find.

The Richmond store is one of my favorite Grocery Outlets (the newer store in Alameda ties for first place). Anytime I‚Äôve been there (even during the Covid lockdown) the vibe has been pretty chill. It feels a bit more spacious than some of the other stores and I like how they group most of the healthy and organic food together. I‚Äôve also had a good success rate with picking up nice things there ‚Äì my latest find, last week, was a 2.5 lb vegan Holiday Roast from Gardein (normally $20) for $6! There‚Äôs always plenty of parking and staff members are friendly. On recent trips, I‚Äôve picked up:

‚Ä¢	Many vegetarian and vegan meat substitutes from Quorn, Gardein, Field Roast, and others
‚Ä¢	Plant-based alternatives to butter and cheese, including Miyoko‚Äôs and Milkadamia
‚Ä¢	Plant-based milks, including Oatley, Ripple, and Hope & Sesame
‚Ä¢	Snacks like cassava chips, vegan puffs, seeds and nuts
‚Ä¢	Wine from Napa, Sonoma, Paso Robles and Lodi
‚Ä¢	Local chocolate from Charles Chocolate and Ocho

There are a lot of people in the US who can‚Äôt afford quality food and places like the Grocery Outlet allow them to buy organic or plant-based food at discount prices. Once the economic impact of Covid-19 starts to really take effect then affordable food will become paramount.

Overall, I think that the Grocery Outlet deserves 4/5 Green Stars for social and environmental impact, based on these factors:

‚Ä¢	Stocking food that would otherwise be in danger of being tossed out because of packaging changes, overstock, imperfections, or looming expiration dates, is part of a solution to the huge problem of food waste. According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, 30 percent of food is wasted globally across the supply chain, contributing 8 percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions. If food waste were a country, it would come in third after the United States and China in terms of impact on global warming.
‚Ä¢	Stores have been trending towards stocking more plant-based and organic food.
‚Ä¢	The Grocery Outlet stocks a good number of brands that rate well, ethically.
‚Ä¢	A good number of these brands are also smaller, local companies.
‚Ä¢	On Glassdoor you can get a feel for how happy employees are at the Grocery Outlet. The average rating for Grocery Outlet is a decent 3.4 out of 5 but the stores are independently owned so experiences vary. For example, an employee at a San Francisco store mentions good benefits including full health insurance, while employees at other stores seem to receive minimum wage and no benefits. So it‚Äôll vary from store to store.
‚Ä¢	They have an annual Independence from Hunger campaign that raises funds or food donations for local shelters and food banks.

I have been introducing more plant based proteins into my diet. I stumbled across this place on Instagram a while back and the food always looked great.
Today my wife and I stopped in and I am happy that we did. I got the Philly box. The only thing I would have changed about the box is that I would add a fork. I picked up my sandwich and some of the filing spilled out into my perfectly crispy fries. Once my sandwich was gone I poured my left over queso sauce on the combo. (Luckily I had a spare plastic spoon in the glove box) It was a perfect combination. I could see a box of fries, Philly filling and queso sauce being a perfect dish to add to the menu.

My wife and I took one trip to the store and worked with one of the owners. She spent a considerable amount of time with us and was patient while we measured each aspect of the couch, sat on many couches, and tried multiple cushion firmnesses. She worked with us and drew the specs that we wanted. We chose from a massive selection of fabrics and colors (at least hundreds, possibly thousands). We weren't sure about the height of the couch and she told us to get one with taller legs and that, if it was too tall, they would give us shorter legs for free. The couch was not expensive, either: $1260, total, for a four seater.

Let me be clear, we customized almost every part of the couch: the height of the legs, the height of the skirt, the height of the cushion we sat on, the height of the back cushions, the length, the depth, etc. It was great to get a custom couch for a such a good price and for not that much time and effort.",California,4.6,Sofa Club,88,1,Retail,['Furniture store'],Los Angeles,2021-01-08,4.559058743098696,4,34.0349889,-118.4338389

It was an interesting experience to say the least. There are many homeless people wandering the area and most of the shops are closed due to COVID-19. We did see a few restaurants who were serving outdoors and decided to try barley mash because it had great reviews. We actually wanted to try their fish and chips since many other people said it was some of the best they had experienced, however they do not serve this dish during their lunch hour. There were many other great choices like their buffalo chicken flatbread, loaded fries, and ceviche. There's a large variety of craft beer and cocktails and overall our experience and food was excellent. I would recommend stopping in if you're ever in this area. I doubt we'll be back unless they clean up the streets and homeless problem. I was with my family and granddaughters and they felt very uncomfortable being in that area. It's unfortunate that San Diego doesn't take more pride in this historic part of the city. My daughter said 10 years ago it was a very positive experience for her.

Thank you for your message. In response, there was a valet lot immediately next to the main entrance.  It had a employee and a stand and patio umbrella.  The handicap space was open and i asked if i could park there and he simply said no, it's a private lot.  He didn't mention that there was a much bigger lot in the back so i drove around the whole neighborhood looking for parking and just happen to drive behind the building and find the other lot.

Also charging for parking when you actually do make a purchase (at both the restaurant and store) seems a little odd when the parking in the near by area difficult.

Perhaps there needs to be a sign stating there is a bigger lot in the back and most importantly have your staff better trained at customer service. He seems to be annoyed that i was trying to park.

That said, the staff inside the store was fantastic. Though i never did get a call back for a request to see if NY had a shirt in a smaller size for me.  Perhaps these are all growing pains?

They are hit or miss like any. The good thing is they have plenty of water spouts. There are shady spots and some that are just out in the open.
Facilities:
Plenty of showers. They take quarters. 1 dollar for 3 mins. Bathrooms were okay. Lots of porter pottys around which was great for a quick situation.
Lake:
The boating on the lake was wonderful. Nice and big. Tge boat rental went smoothly. They have kayaks, peddle boats,  motor boats, pontoon boats which are good for the family. Great to explore and very reasonable prices.

I had an Old Fashioned to drink. It‚Äôs their only whiskey-based cocktail on the menu and whiskey is my go-to. I thought it was a little harsh tasting relative to other Old Fashions I‚Äôd had recently and nearby but points to them for the single large cube of ice in the middle.

You can get any burger with a plant-based Beyond Burger patty available. My wife got one lettuce-wrapped. (They also offer a gluten-free bun) She thought it was a little overcooked (She likes her beyond burgers juicy and pink.), but generally enjoyed it, including the spicy ‚Äú1000 sauce‚Äù it came with. She had ordered it without onions and it came with them anyway. (ahh the curse of special orders‚Ä¶) She thought the butter lettuce was nice as a wrap.

I had The Tipsy Style Burger, subbing bbq sauce for the 1000, with a beyond patty. I liked it.

I got tots on the side because I wasn‚Äôt in the mood for thin-fries or sweet potatoes.

Our server was nice and dealt with all of my jokes about the decor. (The walls were decorated with knives and a big roll of butcher paper‚Ä¶my mind wandered at the possibilities.)

The atmosphere was cool with good music playing and there were families present letting us know they were kid-friendly as well.

Also on the menu for vegetarians are a few sides, Truffle Mac and Cheese, Blue Cheese Tots, Fried Cheese Curds and Buffalo Cauliflower plus salads. (The Beyond Burger is the only main option, but that‚Äôs okay since this is primarily a burger place.) You can get shakes too to blend your desire to be in an upscale new-American burger joint that offers a nouveau 50‚Äôs diner menu.

477 East Colorado Boulevard
Architects: Marston & Maybury
Primary Architectural Style: Art Deco
Builder: John H. Simpson

Building expresses the exuberance of Art Deco decoration better than any other in Pasadena.  Note the amazing use of glazed terra cotta details on the fa√ßade - designed by Jess Stanton, who also did design work on the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. The building has housed Linden Optometry for many years.

Reinforced concrete structure is a long (130 feet), single-story string of retail spaces, able to house six of seven individual small shops, but now used for a single business.

Completely fanciful perforated design is based on spiral forms, somewhat reminiscent of sea shells, and executed in green glazed terra cotta forming a grille for the transoms above the display windows. Terra cotta was built by Gladding, Mc Bean and Co. the major portion of the fa√ßade is blank with small relief panels at intervals repeating the circle, swirl and spiral design motifs.

Building was commissioned by Thomas W. Warner, prominent Pasadena citizen and founder of the Borg-Warner Company. In its early ears it housed a row of exclusive shop catering to the guests of the nearby Maryland Hotel and other wealthy winter visitors to Pasadena.

The original shops at the time of the building‚Äôs opening, representative of the type of specialty retail which led the Pasadena Playhouse Historic District to thrive commercially, included: Howarter Millinery; George A. Clark Company, ‚ÄúCorrect Dress for Men‚Äù; Fred T. Huggins, Shoes; Max Littwitz, Inc., Fine Linens; A.

There is a short loop hike from the parking lot in the old growth redwoods which are just massive. There is also longer hikes along creeks and up into the mountain. Anywhere from a mile to around 10 mile loops. Good elevation when you go up to observation deck. One annoying thing is that the trails are sand...somewhat deep sand...when you get off the paved trail going up to the observation deck. Also had a nice greeter that stopped me in the parking lot to give some quick details and point me in the right direction. Overall beautiful hike with different landscapes and plenty of big redwoods.

Live Complex is this Asian-fusion restaurant by Wolfgang Puck. You have to walk through the more casual (and casually priced) ‚ÄúThe Nest‚Äù to get to it for it‚Äôs more formal dining experience‚Ä¶though if you want to save a few shekels, check out the menu of The Nest as they share a kitchen and many of the same menu items. (Plus you‚Äôll get the same view of downtown out of the gloriously large windows.

We had an amazing experience at WP24 from start to finish. The staff were incredibly attentive to our needs and we were delighted that they offered a completely separate vegetarian and completely separate gluten free menu with lots of choices on both which will leave you feeling well taken care of if either of these diets is yours.

I had the Impossible Dumplings (which you‚Äôll only find on the vegetarian menu. Thee are a awesomely flavored fried dumplings (which reminded me a little more of egg rolls than dumplings) made with ‚ÄúImpossible‚Äù brand meat. The ‚Äúmeat‚Äù was well flavored (which isn‚Äôt always the case when faux-meats are offered leaving you to wonder if some kitchens feel simply offering the option is enough‚Ä¶not the case here‚Ä¶super delicious!) It had a lovely and spicy vegetable topping too.

The Fitness area is a very large room which has a lot of machines that you can use on your own or take private classes.  They have treadmills, free weights, Ellipticals, Bicycles, assisted bench presses, and they have a full on Yoga room which has classes that run up until around 9 pm.  It is really a great service they offer with all type of equipment and a variety of classes.

The classes for that particular month included Zumba, Kickboxing, a cardio training class, Salsa combined with Zumba, Tai Chi, Cardio Weights, Sculpting and all types of Yoga level classes which is nice for beginners like myself.  They really have a large array of classes to get you in shape.  The people are great to work with as well.  I was extremely impressed.

You can buy day passes at $35 or $45 depending upon the day of the week, or you can buy memberships which include the basic or bronze membership to the unlimited membership.  Both of these memberships include use of the locker rooms, resting rooms which include coffee and snacks I believe, and assorted discounts on the use of the salon, restaurant, and up to a 20% discount on room rates.

The shell is set against the backdrop of the Hollywood Hills and the famous Hollywood Sign to the northeast.

They have the mandatory fire hydrant and they have a four-sided picnic bench with what can only be described as a monstrous tree right by it!! This tree would be at home up among the giant redwoods.

One of the reasons I support the Gross Out is that it‚Äôs actually playing a part in tackling the huge problem of food waste. I also enjoy shopping there because of the unpredictability of what I might find. The Pleasant Hill store has quite the following on Facebook as the co-owner Jason does daily video updates on what‚Äôs in the store. Just a few days ago Sen. Bill Dodd named their store Contra Costa County's Small Business of the Year, citing their contributions to the community. Congrats, Kathy and Jason! On recent trips to the Grocery Outlet, I‚Äôve picked up:

‚Ä¢	Many vegetarian and vegan meat substitutes from Quorn, Gardein, Field Roast, and others
‚Ä¢	Plant-based alternatives to butter and cheese, including Miyoko‚Äôs and Milkadamia
‚Ä¢	Plant-based milks, including Oatley, Ripple, and Hope & Sesame
‚Ä¢	Snacks like cassava chips, vegan puffs, seeds and nuts
‚Ä¢	Wine from Napa, Sonoma, Paso Robles and Lodi
‚Ä¢	Local chocolate from Charles Chocolate and Ocho

Overall, I think that the Grocery Outlet deserves 4/5 Green Stars for social and environmental impact, based on these factors:

‚Ä¢	Stocking food that would otherwise be in danger of being tossed out because of packaging changes, overstock, imperfections, or looming expiration dates, is part of a solution to the huge problem of food waste. According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, 30 percent of food is wasted globally across the supply chain, contributing 8 percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions. If food waste were a country, it would come in third after the United States and China in terms of impact on global warming.
‚Ä¢	Stores have been trending towards stocking more plant-based and organic food.
‚Ä¢	The Grocery Outlet stocks a good number of brands that rate well, ethically.
‚Ä¢	A good number of these brands are also smaller, local companies.
‚Ä¢	On Glassdoor you can get a feel for how happy employees are at the Grocery Outlet. The average rating for Grocery Outlet is a decent 3.4 out of 5 but the stores are independently owned so experiences vary.
‚Ä¢	They have an annual Independence from Hunger campaign that raises funds or food donations for local shelters and food banks.

I enjoyed all the unique stores and especially liked the style of Shoreline Village which reminded me of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard, which I love.

I wish there was more areas in California like this Village. One of the best attractions in Long Beach. You will love it!

Each dish has a ""slight"" flaw, almost enough to actually make it believe that yes, not the original chef craft is lost in translation. But it is ever so well done. The pulpo (octopus) was grilled to perfection but the sauce was slightly bland. The crab croquets blended cheese perfectly but the innards were slightly lukewarm. Churros could've been a bit more crispier. The steak a bit more gentle. It was perfect with the hint of human. And then the paella negra... this was something from heaven.
