This does not seem like the kind of joint that should attract the amount of attention that it does. As taco shops go, it's not particularly cheap, it lacks that ""slick"" trendiness you expect from an eatery popular with young people, it's in the ""downtown"" area of La Jolla but kinda off to the side, and the food... well, some of the food here is very good, some of it is kind of bad.

During my first trip, I ordered the ""Sonora Taco"" and the ""Nopal (Cactus) Taco."" I instead got an ""Al Pastor Taco"" and ""Nopal Taco."" Because I was in a rush and had already waited in line for far longer than I expected, I let it go.

The ""Nopal Taco"" was not good at all. The cactus is supposedly ""flame-grilled"" but it tasted steamed. I've had great nopales asados elsewhere, and this was not that. The taco was very plain, consisting of bland under-seasoned cactus, chopped tomatoes, and mild cheese. Not my idea of a party.

The ""Al Pastor Taco"" was quite a bit better, but below-average for San Diego. The pork was well-crusted and shaved off a trompo, but was rubbery inside. The combined taco was too sweet and wet due to the many small chunks of pineapple added to it. The taqueros in L.A. who add chunks of pineapple to their Al Pastor tacos typically exercise more restraint in addition to using a less sweet pineapple. Of course, pineapple chunks in Al Pastor tacos are not as common in San Diego (not as common as in L.A., for example) due to the heavy influence of bordering Tijuana and that city's adobada-style tacos.

My lunch was redeemed by the Taco Stand's ""Churros."" They were handed to me piping hot and with a sweet dipping sauce on the side that bore an uncanny resemblance to Toaster Streudel vanilla icing, and I mean that in a good way. The churros are crunchy, but also delicate enough to pretty much melt in your mouth once your teeth penetrate their crispy exterior.

When I returned to ""The Taco Stand"" more recently, I again ordered the ""Sonora Taco"" and, this time, I actually received it. The Sonora Taco consists of a flour tortilla stuffed with deliciously browned cubes of Certified Angus Beef, chili, cumin, and salt seasoning seared into them. The taco would have been fine with just that, but it is enhanced with melted cheese, pinto beans, guacamole, onion, and cilantro. I recommend adding the habanero salsa from the salsa bar as well -- it complements the ""Sonora Taco"" perfectly. Do what I told you, and you'll end up eating a very solid taco. Again, on my second visit, the line moved glacially slow. On a Thursday evening at around 8pm, I waited 25 minutes just for the pleasure of ordering anything.

With such inconsistency, this should not be a place that is as popular as it is. But if it keeps the crowds away from my favorite taquerias in South Bay, I guess I'm OK with that.",California,2019-11-21 15:22:10,4.6,The Taco Stand,3433,1,Food & Beverage,601,5402.0,['Mexican restaurant' 'Burrito restaurant' 'Fast food restaurant'],other,2019-11-21

Rather than being sweetened with pineapple as Al Pastor pork typically is, the sweetness in Taco 1986's recipe supposedly comes from strawberries, which is unusual on this side of the border, even for Tacos de Adobada. Also, Tijuana-style Tacos de Adobada are typically served in a parchment paper used to pinch the taco closed.

I enjoyed the texture of the adobada meat at Tacos 1986: some pieces crispy and charred like sturdy bacon, other pieces tender and sticky. I also enjoyed the white corn tortilla used in this taco, griddled until it started to brown -- another unusual twist for a Los Angeles taco purveyor. I ordered my taco ""con todo"" and it was topped with guacamole, chopped onions, and cilantro. Any application of salsas is DIY, and I recommend you add the incendiary salsa macha.

Taco 1986's ""Taco de Adobada"" would perhaps be in the same top tier as the ""Al Pastor"" offerings from Leo's, El Flamin', and Ave 26 Taco Stand if the adobo glaze on the meat itself didn't have as grassy of a finish. I like achiote laying on my tastebuds when I eat adobada pork, but Taco 1986 takes it just a touch too far, and the strawberries don't provide enough sweetness to balance the bitterness.

A better option to order is the ""Carne Asada Vampiro."" A ""Vampiro"" is a taco made using tortilla shells that have been griddled for a while over low-heat until they are dry and crunchy; the tortillas contract and ruffle a bit during this process, often resembling a ""vampire bat wing,"" hence the name. Some taquerias serve their vampiros as one tortilla topped with melted white cheese and the toppings, while other places, including Tacos 1986, use two corn tortillas to make a ""sandwich,"" similar to a mulita, stuffed with the toppings and melted cheese.

The ""Carne Asada Vampiro"" here lacks for nothing. Besides being stuffed with one of the most deliciously-seasoned renditions of carne asada I've had in Los Angeles, the supporting guacamole and melted white cheese are also top notch and issued in a perfectly harmonious ratio with the smoky beef. Vampiro ""shells"" elsewhere can often end up with a stale texture due to lazy cooking, but here they are perfectly crispy.",California,2019-11-21 23:53:08,4.2,Tacos 1986,471,1,Food & Beverage,601,26323.0,['Mexican restaurant'],Los Angeles,2019-11-21

The must-try item here are the spicy adobada pork tacos. The delicious slow-roasted adobada pork is shaved directly off of a rotating vertical skewer ""al pastor"" style onto 2 tortillas, and then topped with avocado sauce, onions, cilantro, and picante sauce. If you like cheese, try the same adobada pork in a mula.

Feeling adventurous? The tender lengua (beef tongue) and flavorful tripa (tripe) tacos are also delicious.

Prices are very reasonable. Tip on parking: forget trying to find a space in the small lot around the restaurant except during very rare non-busy times. Instead, park in the large parking lot at the trolley station across from Carl's Jr.

By eschewing corn tortillas for flour tortillas, South Beach's tacos have more weight and are a bit more filling than other seafood tacos around town. Two is enough to fill me up. My favorites are the grilled mahi and the fried pollock, but all of them are pretty good and over-stuffed with tomatoes, cilantro, onion, cheese, cabbage, and covered in a delicious sour cream/ranch-like white sauce. Ranging from $3-$4 each, the tacos are pretty good value.

Be forewarned -- the fried clam strips ought to be avoided. I grew up near Boston, so I may be over-sensitive to this, but the stringy, rubbery excuse for fried clams here have the taste and texture of Long John Silver's left-overs that have been re-heated in a microwave. Also, this is not really an ideal dinner date place, unless your idea of romance is downing beers 'n shots in a dusty, low-lit sports bar among depressed locals and wide-eyed tourists. Ambiance is divey, most of the other non-taco items on the menu are so-so, and you should prepare to get carded upon entry (regardless of time of day, and even if you look like you're 63 years old), but the fish tacos are damn special.",California,2019-11-10 14:46:16,4.4,South Beach Bar & Grille,2632,1,Food & Beverage,601,8738.0,['Bar & grill' 'American restaurant' 'Bar'],San Diego,2019-11-10

I'm just not sure why they had to make it a 'berto's-style taco shop at its base. The Mexican side of this operation is barely such -- it's like if you positioned your cuisine as Filipino/Italian fusion but based it all on the classic American ""checkered tablecloth"" ""red sauce"" joint that serves pizza by the slice.

I ordered the ""Pac Man Burrito,"" one of Sayulitas' most popular offerings. It is an enormous flour tortilla stuffed with tocino (sweet Filipino bacon), carne asada, French fries, sour cream, pico de gallo, and shredded yellow cheese. Named after legendary Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao (currently a senator in the Philippines), I couldn't ever imagine the svelte prizefighter (5'5"", 146 pounds) consuming a burrito this large. Seriously, if we're losing our minds over large cups of soda, this burrito needs to be declared a public health hazard. It has the calories of a week's worth of meals wrapped into the largest flour tortilla I've ever seen.

While the size of the ""Pac Man Burrito"" was something to behold, I disliked that the ingredients are all bunched together rather than spread out evenly within the tortilla. The distribution of the fillings made this burrito difficult to eat, as there is nothing pleasant about chomping off a bite that only includes cold shredded cheese and flour tortilla, or just pico and sour cream with flour tortilla, or whatever. At its core, this is really just a large California Burrito but with Filipino tocino. The novelty of this was interesting at first, but I was already tired of eating it after working through the first 7 or 8 bites (i.e. the first 1% of it). The carne asada was bland and mediocre, the fries were soft and flaccid, and the gigantic flour tortillas they use are otherwise rubbish and smell like gym shoes.

I preferred the ""Longaniza Taco,"" which consisted of Filipino-style longaniza, pico de gallo, and guacamole. The longaniza is sweet, a little spicy, but very good. I liked its somewhat crispy surface and overall juiciness. This taco was good, with potential to be a ""top 25"" taco in San Diego except for the dire quality of the bagged corn tortillas they use. The tortillas taste like chemicals, a relative disaster associated with an otherwise great idea. The red sauce from the salsa bar is pretty good and is your best salsa pairing with this.

Be forewarned that the atmosphere of this Mira Mesa taco shop was loud, even at 9:30am on a Friday morning when I was there. They had whatever is the modern equivalent of COPS blasting on their TV at volumes that shook the inside of my head. This place is interesting for sure, but deeply flawed.",California,2019-11-10 14:44:32,4.4,Sayulitas Mexican Food,748,1,Food & Beverage,601,30147.0,['Mexican restaurant'],San Diego,2019-11-10
4.0,108685370139018629938,0x80c2cb6ac8fc62bb:0x82f9fefddc0dc252,Jay Keyes,4,"For me, there is no more interesting ""regional"" taco in Los Angeles than the ""black taco,"" a type of taco that has been invented and evolved over the past 40+ years in black neighborhoods located within the urban sprawl beginning in South Central Los Angeles and ending in Compton. Black tacos have their own unique distinctive style, look, taste, and nomenclature, yet are not found outside of this micro-region.

Don't get me wrong, there are different varieties of black tacos, but the basics are a tortilla (usually a white corn tortilla, but flour can be used as well) filled with ground beef or turkey, lots of shredded yellow cheese, lettuce, diced tomatoes, and either sour cream or some kind of sweet barbecue-like ""sauce"" or both. There are no onions or cilantro in a typical black taco. Sr. Cliff's ""Turkey Taco"" is what I just described, with seasoned clumps of ground turkey that are grilled until they're browned and deposited into a soft corn tortilla with tomatoes, cheese, lettuce, and sour cream.

Sr. Cliff's can also serve their tacos with onions and cilantro on double corn tortillas, eschewing all of the other toppings. They call this ""Mexican-style."" I ordered a ""Ground Beef Taco"" of this variety, and it was exactly what you would expect it to be, though the grilling technique that Sr. Cliff's cooks use for their ground meats imparts plenty of flavor due to the thick browning picked up through the process. Nonetheless, these are not much more than the kind of tacos that have made billions of dollars over the past 80 years for General Mills' ""Old El Paso"" brand.

However, the combination of soul food and Mexican food on the menus of black-owned restaurants continues to evolve black tacos in South L.A. and Compton. These neighborhoods, once predominantly black, have become more racially mixed over the past few decades, with Compton now being the home to more Latinos than any other race. As Hispanics migrated into these neighborhoods, restaurants previously only serving blacks wisely began offering Mexican dishes on their menu. For example, Sr. Cliff's offers menudo and pozole.

The next step, of course, was integration between both sides of the menu. The ""Soul Man Taco"" served at Sr. Cliff's uses pastrami in addition to ground beef for its meat, and has similar toppings to their regular black taco, but it also comes with a legit salsa roja on the side that wouldn't be out of place in a Boyle Heights taqueria. The woman who served it to me was a Latina, as were the cooks in Sr. Cliff's kitchen. Indeed, Sr. Cliff's ""Soul Man Taco"" veers towards an intriguing direction for black tacos, using and combining ingredients that one wouldn't think to combine in a taco, but make sense due to local culture.

Having been in operation since 1975, owned and run by Cliff Williams the entire time, this is a historic restaurant that prides itself in serving ""real food for real people,"" and has evolved with the times. Sr. Cliff's may not have invented the black taco, nor do they make the best black taco in L.A., but this is probably the best restaurant to go to for understanding what black tacos are, and how they have become essential eats in the communities they can be found in.",California,2019-11-10 14:53:24,4.4,Sr. Cliff's Texas Style Burritos,358,2,Food & Beverage,601,10764.0,['Mexican restaurant' 'American restaurant'],Compton,2019-11-10

Along the way, this unassuming establishment picked up a James Beard Award in the ""American Classics"" category in 2005, 10 years before Guelaguetza, the only other Mexican eatery in L.A. that has won the same award.

Bottom line is that I was disappointed with Yuca's overhyped ""Cochinita Pibil Taco"" but loved their ""Double Cheeseburger.""

First, the ""Cochinita Pibil Taco"":
- double white corn tortillas pulled from a bag
- sweet citrus and achiote were the dominant flavors; the sour element was non-existent in the recaudo rojo to the point where it really did not taste like cochinita pibil at all (not to say what I ate was terrible, it just wasn't what I ordered)
- the pork used to make the pibil tasted funny and possibly was spoiled or had slight boar taint
- the taco comes topped with chopped tomatoes and fresh onions, not pickled onions (the latter being a more traditional accompaniment)
- the taco is served wrapped in foil

And now the ""Double Cheeseburger"":
- bun toasted in burger grease on both sides
- crusty burger patties covered in melted gooey cheese with enough vegetal condiments to provide the ""illusion of freshness""
- on par with an ""In N Out"" double-double but somehow came out way faster
- all of the above statements about the burger are ""features,"" not ""bugs""

In short, Yuca's ought to move on from regional Mexican cuisine and instead start a burger chain.",California,2019-11-08 02:20:37,4.4,Yuca's,358,1,Food & Beverage,601,5483.0,['Mexican restaurant' 'American restaurant' 'Restaurant'],Los Angeles,2019-11-08

This review is for their outpost in Hillcrest, a spotlessly clean location on the corner of 6th and University with conscientious, friendly, and helpful staff. I'll never forget my first time here while I was blissfully scarfing down a pair of battered fish tacos and one of the dudes behind the counter encouraged me to try the homemade sauces in the refrigerator to ""bring it to another level."" Despite being ""fast casual,"" these are good people who genuinely care about whether or not you're enjoying their food.

The prices for Oscar's outrageously high-quality food are ridiculously low. Yes, you could get some comparable fish tacos from a good San Diego food truck and pay a little less, but this is way easier to deal with. I could eat here every day of the year, not have a problem with it, and spend very little on food.

Each of Oscar's tacos are delicious in their own way, and it is difficult to have to choose between them during each trip to their restaurant. The essential menu items that everyone should try once in their lives are:

Spicy Shrimp Taco - single corn tortilla wrapped around lots of tiny shrimp grilled in a spicy and sweet sauce, with tomatoes, cilantro, a couple of wedges of avocado, and cabbage. This taco does not need additional sauce, it is plenty hot on its own.

Battered Fish Taco - I really like you, Rubio's, but Oscar's battered fish taco destroys yours. Seriously, it doesn't get much better than this scrumptious corn tortilla filled with battered fish, cabbage, tomatoes, red onions, and cilantro, especially when topped with Oscar's homemade chipotle sauce.

Smoked Fish Taco - this taco features super-savory, well-salted fish ""sausage"" (the fish is ground into a corned beef hash consistency) with cabbage, tomatoes, avocado chunks, and onions. Make no mistake, this is absolutely delicious, and could be my favorite taco from Oscar's depending on my mood. My only complaint is that you barely taste any indication that you're eating fish, but that's not a bad thing.

Where Oscar's further sets themselves apart are with their complimentary homemade sauces available to you in their cooler in squeeze bottles, which include:

Homemade Habanero Aioli - spicy hot and slightly sweet mayo-like sauce - this is a favorite of mine when paired with the Smoked Fish Taco.

Homemade Red Pepper Sauce - earthy and fresh liquefied hot pico de gallo.

Homemade Chipotle Cream Aioli - smoky medium hot sauce that lends itself well to seafood. This pairs well with any of Oscar's seafood tacos.

Oscar's offers refreshing pitchers of aguas fresca (water infused with slices of fruit) free-of-charge on their counter.

As you first bite into one of Mitla Café's Beef Tacos (labeled as just ""Taco"" on the menu), you can't help but think of a Taco Bell's taco, except done 100 times better. As grease and juices fall out of the house-made misshapen fried tortilla, you'll taste the heavily-browned and spiced ground beef covered with shredded cheddar cheese, refreshing lettuce, and bright red tomatoes, and you will understand why someone would start a fast food company around this. Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good, because for as many billions of dollars that the Taco Bell brand is worth, Glen Bell ultimately failed to capture what makes this taco work.

Mitla Café's ""Shredded Beef Taco"" is probably a better taco than their regular ""Taco,"" but it doesn't channel the same kind of nostalgia. The ""Shredded Beef Taco"" does, however, have a cleaner flavor and truer purity of purpose. Either taco greatly benefits from the red sauce (you need to ask for a side of it when you order), a fiery salsa that puts Taco Bell's little spicy ketchup packets to shame.

During my visit, I also ordered the Pozole, which is served white (i.e. Pozole Blanco), with minimal garnishes (no oregano, for example), and pork that was over-cooked. My advice is to pass on the Pozole and eat more tacos. In fact, always eat more tacos.

--

I recall that a few years back that Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails was horrified and saddened to learn that the U.S. CIA was blasting songs off of his 1994 album, ""The Downward Spiral,"" at the highest possible volume during brutal interrogations of sleep-deprived enemy combatants as a way to further intimidate and disorient them. I suspect that every time someone like me writes about the connection Mitla Café has to Taco Bell, the present-day owners, descendants of Mrs. Rodriguez, have a similar reaction as Mr. Reznor had to his art being used so abusively. Or perhaps they understand things as I do: Glen Bell himself confesses to have stolen their recipe but, given the chasm between what they serve and what Taco Bell serves, there's little evidence he actually used it.

Nachos - These were great actually, huge platter of em, great chips
Chips & Queso - These were good, but we really didn't need them since we had the Nachos lol
Rebel Burger - My daughter said it had a ""funny taste"" and she's not very picky about her burgers, so that's not good.  She did love the fries though.
Doritos Fried Chicken - First issue with this was that they didn't have the Mashed potatoes that come with it, except they didn't tell us that until all of the food was coming out, so my wife got fries rather than wait additional time for Mashed Potatoes.  Then when she got it, she was super underwhelmed.  Dry & overfried chicken, no real Dorito taste, and overcooked Brusselsprouts
Spicy Cheeto Fried Chicken Sandwich - This was OK, it wasn't spicy and it was dry/overfried but since it was covered in slaw you couldn't tell.  So meh.

The waiter was really nice, but unfortunately, there seemed to be just him and the cook, so the service was way slower than I would have expected which was of course not ideal either :(  With the choices in the immediate area here, I doubt I'll be back.",California,2020-01-28 00:01:00,4.0,Rebel Kitchen & Libations,57,1,Food & Beverage,810,146399.0,['Restaurant'],Livermore,2020-01-28

Our Captain was Don, and he had a great sense of humor. He really enjoyed being our guide and telling us a lot of funny stories about people who have lived there, movies made, and lots of miscellaneous info.

The trip takes about 1 hour and costs $18.50 per adult, 16:50 for seniors, and I believe it was $14.00 for children.  The two of us went on the tour at 11:00 am.

I don't want to point out any of the celebrity homes or history, since it is pretty neat hearing it for the first time.  It is not too costly to see the full lake.

They also have a huge yoga room in which they do yoga classes for all levels or aerobic workouts, Zumba, etc.  I was really impressed at the size of the yoga room.

I was fortunate to actually meet the chef, Heath Miller, and he is very creative and always trying to make new and exciting dishes, especially dinners.  We ate dinner there on Nov 8th and although the menu is a bit pricey, the food is wonderful and the experience is great.  The Chef is really cool, and I got to know him a bit, and he is always looking to making new creations.  They had the diver scallops as their go-to item that night, but we chose a couple of different menu items.

I had the chicken saltimbocca with a Cesar salad and a shrimp cocktail for the appetizer.  They were great.  I didn't realize the salad came with anchovies, but i was able to remove them.  lol.  The whole thing was great.  The chicken was perfectly marinated with prosciutto and it came with risotto.

My girlfriend has the french onion soup and she said it was the best she ever had.  We split some chips and salsa and they were better than most Mexican restaurants we go to, then she ended up having the 20 oz. French Bone-in Rib-eye with roasted potatoes.  She also said this was the best steak ever!

For desert we got the tiramisu and that was super rich and awesome.  The chef brought us a special off-item menu item cheesecake which had 24 carat gold icing and a strawberry as well.  It was out of this world!

The Spa Director Summer Barron is great and she will handle all your needs and questions.  We went down there this past week and my girlfriend had a massage and then had a pedicure and manicure.  Erin gave her the massage and it was great, and then Rhonda did her nails and feet.  She loved it.  She felt like a whole new person.

They use gels for manicures and pedicures and they can either give you a hair cut or a style with shampoo.  They sometimes do bridal parties and I got to talk to two of the people there at the salon itself and they were both extremely nice and professional.

And with all Bay Area Philz locations I have been to, the friendly baristas know their stuff and are very familiar with both Philz’s coffee and food menus. They can quickly figure out what your like to drink if you need drink recommendations while quickly getting down to business and making your customized coffee drink while you wait.

I always do like their prompt, reassuring Philz statement as the Barista hands you the cup - “taste it before you leave to be sure your happy” — so you are never disappointed with what you ordered. I have never asked to make me another coffee.

There is seating both indoors and outdoors. Front doors are wide open so very easy for a disabled person to get in and out without any assistance.

To reduce your wait time, it is faster to order ahead using the Philz app.

With your $10/adult admission fee, you are given a self-guided garden booklet which list the different number paths to enjoy looking and photographing different succulents, cacti, aloe, agave, and native California plants and wildflowers (California poppies were in full bloom in April).

There are chairs and tables and benches scattered around the garden to sit, enjoy, and eat your food you bring in.

The friendly volunteer docents are full of plant information or can get information from one of the Ruth Bancroft Garden staff members.

While the garden is right next to busy Bancroft Rd, walking around here can feel like a mini getaway or oasis.

The garden is flat with either dirt or gravel paths. Easily accessible for both babies in strollers, toddlers walking themselves, and people who used walkers or wheelchairs. The docents make everyone who enters feel welcome.

In the plant nursery has many of the plants you see in the garden for sale. The plants are either propagated in the on-site greenhouses or from from growers around the country. Many of the water-conservation plants are either California natives or have origins from around the globe.

If you are a Bay Area gardener, you will get great inspiration visiting the garden or the nursery. And if you enjoy taking pictures of plants and gardens, you will be among the many photogs with their cameras on their tripods looking to take their next photo.

November 2019 Update: Went to garden to see what was blooming during autumn. There was a bucket of “free umbrellas” at the garden entrance to be used if you wanted to protect yourself from the sun and heat.

What we like about Banseok Jeong is how generous they are with their banchan (small plate appetizers) in terms of variety and quality than many other Korean restaurants. For two, they will serve 12 sides and we always ask for a second round for everything.

I personally ask if they have any dried jerky fish every time I go. Sometimes I get, sometimes I don't.

At the end of the meal, they serve a refreshing chilled cinnamon soup. It's like tastes like chewing Big Red gum. Cleanses your palate and breath from all that kimchee and garlic!

3.5 Stars for now as I know I will return. Late night Asian Food dining at The Carlsbad Mall.

Large restaurant and a great addition. They've been open a little over a week now. Glad I stopped by when it was not as busy.

When we walked in we were surprised with the beautiful decor and quite spacious.  Nice looking bar with speciality drinks.

The hostess was very nice.  There were a few booths that were not cleaned and I wanted to sit on one of them so she started to clean it herself. Props to her!

We sat there for a bit and no one came to attend to us. Finally someone who was on break (she said) returned and noticed that we were not helped. She eventually came by and asked if we were waiting long. Although we were, we said she was fine. Not sure who was supposed to be watching her tables while she was on break.

Food:
Xia Long Bao
Hot & Sour Soup
Won Ton Soup

The XLB was good and I am a fan of a handful of GOOD Dumpling restaurants.  Wish they had more sauces to choose from like vinegar etc. Glad that we asked for some kind of sauce and the server was able to get chili oil.

The soups were good and satisfying. The won ton soup had 3 pork and shrimp wonton and 2 pieces of shrimp with tender chicken. Not a fan of the hot & sour soup.

Overall, I will return again. The menu is extensive with a mixture of different Asian Cuisine.",California,2019-10-09 02:45:37,4.0,Wokcano Carlsbad,123,2,Food & Beverage,330,56797.0,['Asian restaurant' 'Asian fusion restaurant' 'Chinese restaurant'],other,2019-10-09

We walked in for a table for 2. They were very busy and there was one table left. We sat at the table and it was a little uncomfortable.  There was no where to put my purse and I held it in my lap. The hostess did mention if another table becomes available she will move us. Yay! A few booths opened up so we moved quickly. That made my experience so much better.

The service is good and the workers are accommodating. I also met Young the owner. She too is very nice and pleasant.

Food:
Tonkotsu Ramen
Garlic Edamame
Teri Salmon Entree
Hawaiian Roll

The food was delicious and so fresh. My only negative i had was the ramen.  It was served in  a stone pot bowl. I failed to ask them to undercook or have my noodles al dente.  Because the soup was so hot, it made my noodles overcooked.  I'll ask next time. The broth was flavorful and I was pleased.

At the event, on the pool side,  i stood by the bar and the bartenders were a little confused if they offered HH drinks to patrons or not. Also, the bartender who helped me was slow and distracted.  He made one drink then while making my 2nd drink he knocked over / spilt my drink. Poor guy.

The furukaki on the egg was just too much. It was not drizzled on. In my opinion, it was extra thick like the cap of the bottle fell off. Happy that it was served in a hot stone.

Wish the meat was seasoned more (even with the sauce). In addition, wish it had Kimchee.

On a separate visit the bulgogi lacked flavor. But the fried mandu was delicious.

Order at the counter and you'll be given a buzzer.

From the outside it looks like a small restaurant but when you walk in there's a lot tables. Patio seating is also available.

We waited for about 17 minutes for a table for two.  There are chairs outside so have a cup of coffee. We walked in with our coffee's so we were charged for it. Not sure if you drink it outside if it's free.

Our server was Marilyn and she was awesome. You can tell she's been doing this for some time. She checked on us from time to time and I heard her speaking to the kitchen because my order was not how I ordered it. That's awesome that she corrected it before bringing the food to my table and me sending it back.

Food:
•Bacon, Eggs, Hashbrowns and White Toast
•Oklahoma Breakfast
The biscuit and gravy was on point. The best I've ever had.
My bacon was cooked to my liking and we also ordered corned beef hash well done.
I washed my food down with a glass of guava mimosa.

We shared chicken mole poblano burrito and grilled prawns fajitas plato. We had 4 choices of sauces and we went bit crazy with the extra hot sauce which was REALLY HOT!!! Salsas were yummy!

Mole burrito was good but not the richest mole we have tried, but it had its own thing going on and definitely got stronger as we reached the bottom of the burrito where i guess it was all soaking ;). Oh and the chicken quality was really good. Grilled prawn fajitas plato was lovely and so light and quite a good amount of prawns in there.

Pretty big place and very busy. We stopped here for lunch as we reached Carmel back in August. It was busy but we waited for a bit and then got seated. Table for 6 was quite small for all of us so we had to watch our elbows while eating which was tad uncomfortable.

Only 1 bathroom for the entire restaurant which was located at the wine tasting room next to it. Horrible way to make your customers suffer :( I wasn't pleased.

Liked the decor around and service was good.

Food was decent. I liked all the items we tried but by no means this was authentic Italian cuisine. Italian recipes served for American diners with heavy and creamy sauces. But, we did have a great time overall no doubt about it. I felt overall food in Carmel was like this, touristy and heavy, not authentic, which is a little sad.

- beet salad
- famous garlic bread
- gilroy roasted garlic plate
- mushroom pizza
- spaghetti alio oglio
- salmon over tagliatelle and asparagus
- veal osso buco ravioli
- lasagna

All entres were good but nothing exceptional. In fact, too heavy eventhough everything was shared between us so we all just had 1 bite of everything. Pastas were good but heavy on the cream kind of scene though I thought my veal ravioli was the best choice.

I've never been to such a horribly poorly designed Costco gas station. When you attempt to merge off the street to pull into into the property your quickly realize that the turn off is completely packed with people because the turn lane dumps directly into the gas station lanes. So basically traffic queues up into the street and all the way too the light...
Not to mention in the about 15 minutes it took to wait (I would've gone elsewhere but once your in line your trapped because of the stupid design), there was 2 people that had to slam on their brakes because people trying to leave just would dart out into traffic because you can't see when existing from all the cars backed up on the street from them trying to get fuel.

I don't rate gas stations much and if I do it's usually good but damn this one was highly disappointing and honestly dangerous. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a lawsuit because of an accident caused by the traffic build up on the road and down the street from people wanting to fill up and having virtually no where to queue up like most Costcos usually give you...

I've been to Tokyo Central numerous times on Artesia and never had anything like this happen. Could be an isolated incident but I wanted to warn others. If You don't have a strong stomach you might want to avoid the prepack foods. It wasn't the California roll because I never got to that part of the meal. Maybe the Eel sushi. Or maybe it was an MSG load from the fried chicken stuff. Well regardless, I was sick as a dog and will never do that again.

The offerings looked a bit old and you can tell they haven’t had much business. The service was ok, but not great. My gelato was actually quite good (pistachio). But the server filled the cup in a way that it got all on the outside rim and exterior. It ended up being a mess! Prices seemed a bit high, but maybe that’s the average price in the area.

Unfortunately, even during the worst of times, there were a few things they could have done to improve. Hand written signs, dirty tables, dried old pineapple in the gelato, and poor customer service. There was also a non customer working or studying outside, using their table, and listening to music. The server never came outside to address it. His music ruined the atmosphere.

The margaritas were amazing and quite strong. I enjoyed the garnishes as an added touch. The queso fundido was lightly brown on top and served with chorizo. The chorizo was not greasy. The enchiladas I ordered looked amazing when they arrived. The sauces were very unique and a bit thicker/creamer than I’m used to. The filling was very moist. It’s hard to put into words how delicious it was.

It’s just north of Hillcrest and short drive from the airport and the beaches. Using GOS in my car the hotel was easy to find and highway access was very close. Overall it’s a great place to stay in San Diego.

The check in experience was nice. In the lobby they have a small corner area with snacks, drinks, and toiletries for sale. There is also a sitting area and one desktop computer with a printer for guests. Due to COVID the restaurant entrance is outside.

The rooms are decent. They each have an exterior door with modern electronic card locks. The rooms are simple but do have some newer upgrades. Each room has a fridge and single cup coffee brewer. There are plenty of electrical outlets and USB outlets in the room and near the bed. There is an iron and board in each room. The bathroom is minimal but does have good toiletries. The toilet/shower area was very small. The water pressure was ok, but not great. The bed and pillows were comfortable. The TV featured about 100+ different channels with an on screen guide. The thermostat in the room was modern. The downsides to the room were the outside noise from the parking lot or people walking by, and you could hear the water run in neighboring rooms.

They have ice, coin laundry (pay by app), and gym on site. The gym is currently closed due to COVID.

Parking on site is free and requires a permit in the window. At night after 9pm the parking spots close to the rooms get filled so you have to park further away. But the hotel has ample parking so there is never a risk of not being able to park you might just have to walk.

WiFi on the property is free. It does require a password. The annoying thing is that it makes you sign in multiple times a day.

The pool area was pretty good. There is lots of covered seating, multiple tables, and lawn chairs. They have free pool toys to use. The pool ranges in depth from 4’ deep to 9’ deep. Unfortunately they don’t have pool towels available and the pool water was a bit gross. There was a thin film on the top (probably from sun screen) and along the water edge the tile was covered with a black greasy substance. The lawn furniture and pool needs a good scrubbing or power washing!

The restaurants on site were quite good. They are practicing social distancing and are busy with locals so you might have to wait. I would recommend ordering take out and eating it in your room. It will be faster and safer during COVID times.

The restaurant is full of windows and offers indoor/outdoor seating. There is also a nice public park where you can eat or relax. Street Taco is a upscale taqueria. The menu is basic and prices are higher than a normal taqueria. The service was mixed ( one was ok, the other was great). Don’t get conned into ordering chips and salsa ($6.50?!??) as your dish probably comes with it.

My biggest complaint is the menu. No where on the menu does it specify next to the non meat dishes the cost to add meat. As the menu is laid out it appears all dishes have meat. Normally it will say +$ to add meat. The menu mentions homemade corn tortillas, but no mention of homemade flour tortillas. There are * next to the seafood dishes, with no mention of what a * means (I’ll assume is the standard raw fish disclaimer). The same * is used to promote the tortillas.  There is a separate sign noting beef is more, but somehow the restaurant created a menu that can’t be edited.

If your going to be an upscale taqueria can you at least fry the tortilla chips every hour? Eating day old chips when the restaurant isn’t busy is not ok. Is it possible to make horchata to order (customize the sugar), instead of serving it like all the other taquerias (store bought from a jug)?",California,2020-06-12 20:24:42,4.5,Street Taco,55,1,Food & Beverage,433,112560.0,['Mexican restaurant'],San Francisco,2020-06-12

Pann's is an Amazing and Historic Place.  Opened in 1958 by the Poulous', Pann's is Not only considered a Coffee Shop Restaurant, but also an institution, for it's history and role in movies, not too mention it's distinct architecture.
Bewitched, xXx, and Pulp Fiction have featured Pann's Restaurant.
In my opinion, without all those things though, Pann's is as Solid as a Breakfast spot as you can find in all of Los Angeles!
Service was Above Standard, particularly by our waitress, Jennifer!! She was positively phenomenal!  The coffee was Perfect.  The Food was Out of This World.

It's Not so much the restaurant itself, although this one is one of the Dirtiest I've been to, but more so the pricing.  What happened to the days when you could get a Six Dollar Burger for around $4.  Now they've not just reached the $6 Mark, but have surpassed it by Several Dollars More!!  In fact, have you seen the menu at Carl's Jr. Lately??  You'd think it's the year 2119!!!  Everything is astronomically High there.  So much so, to take my family or 5 out to dinner here, I'll have to take a Second on my Mortgage!!  Geeez.  In addition, don't try using the bathroom here.  After acquiring a coin to use it, prepare for some UnImaginable sights and smells.  It's as though they want you to vomit what you just ate, if you use the bathroom after eating.  Or in my case, run for the hills instead of ordering off their Unbelivable Priced Meni, because of the Pure Nastiness that I saw in their bathroom.  Anyway you cut it, I'd drive a few miles further north and hit the In & Out @ Sand Canyon.  Yes, there will probably be a line out the door, or cars for days in the drive thru, but there, you will get a fairly priced burger, fries and shake AND you won't need a coin to use their bathroom, which also won't look like 500 inmates in County, just used it.  Good Luck with this place.

Took my son here for a Much Deserved Sushi Fix.  Perhaps a Big Mistake today.  Service was phenomenal, as expected, by Alfonso!  He is a Master at what he does!  Lili was great too.  Sadly, the sushi was NOT good today. 3 out of 9 plates were Bad!  And I don't mean Not Well Made Sushi, but actual Bad Fish!!  Had the manager, Taka, come and try a dish.  Despite him stating it was good, the look on his face told a Completely Different story.  One plate of bad fish is Not good.  THREE in one sitting though??  That's a Serious and Very Concerning Issue!   Despite removing 2 plate charges and tacking on a 10% discount, it may be a while before my son can bring himself to eating at his Favorite Restaurant of All Time.  Overheard some of the wait staff stating that there are 2 sources for fish at Yamatos and perhaps quality control wasn't implemented correctly?  We have Been coming here for nearly 20 years!!  I'd Hate to Leave Them, but I refuse to allow my 11 year old to be subjected to Rotten Sushi!

For starters, we chose to dine in the bar area due to arriving around 4:20pm.  Happy Hour happens to be between 3-5pm on Saturday.  See Menu in Photos for Happy Hour Times/Specials.  Anyway, my counterpart for this meal, M2D2, has been here Countless times.  In fact, when asked, 'If You could pick Anywhere to eat, where would you go?'  Well, the choice was simple.  From Malibu to T.O. we came and was it ever worth it!
So we decided to order off the $5, $6, $7 and $8 Dollar Menu.  It paid off Big Time!! Our 'Poison' of choice was the Lemon Drop Martinis.  Typically a $12 drink, it was 50% off at Happy Hour.  So essentially it was kind of like a Buy One Get One Free, sorta deal.
For our Meal(s), we ordered the $5 Half Order of Onion Rings, which were cooked to Perfection!  The $6 chicken wings.  Unfortunately being a Chicken Wing Connoisseur, I can certainly say I've had Better.  The $7 fish tacos, which I did question our waitress about, and she advised us that the fish inside was Salmon.  I felt it tasted and had the texture of Tilapia, but either way, they were Spot On!  Finally the $8 Prime Rib Sliders!  I feel they just may get their Prime Rib from a little restaurant in Beverly Hills called Lawry's.  The meat was tender and flavorful as Any Prime Rib I've ever had.  As far as the reviewer 4377hn, who happens to have 1 (ONE) Total Google Review from about 2 months ago, their claim of salted food seems a little 'salty.'  🤭
There was No Over Saltiness in all of the meals we had.   In fact, I almost added a little salt myself, but then I though IF my doctor happened to walk by, he would've given me the 'stink eye,' so I held off.
No Vulgar language by any patrons, and certainly NOT by any employees.
Our Waitress, Kayla H., was Positively Phenomenal!  In fact, when we gave her our opinion of the chicken wings just being okay, Not Only did she apologize, she even offered to replace it with something else!  How's that for Service?  Needless to say, after that, and since we didn't finish the chicken wings, we most certainly had no choice but to order the Fresh Strawberry Shortcake! Bandits uses a Freshly Baked Biscuit, then they add ice cream, whipped cream, strawberries, and then top it off with strawberry puree and some powdered sugar.  It was a Treat meant for a King and/or Queen!
There is No Doubt in my mind that I'll be back  Bandits.
This is a Fantastically Solid Restaurant that deserves 5 Stars through and through!!

I needed to make a return, have some oil recycled, and pick up an item.  I was greeted by Andrew whom I explained what I needed to do.  He was prompt and offered good service.  Upon completion of my return, I went to see Juan to drop off some used motor oil for recycling. Sadly, I was Never greeted by Juan At All.  He was assisting another customer who was Not happy with the service he was receiving from Juan and/or Pep Boys Service department.  Andrew, noticing that Juan was a bit overwhelmed, took my filled container of used oil, dumped it, and returned it back to me empty.  All was well.  Went on my way to look for that particular item I needed.  After a few minutes of searching I found it.  Ivan checked me out this time quickly.   All in All, This Pep Boys visit was decent.

Would I come back to this Pep Boys?  Perhaps.  I guess it would depend what I needed.  A decent Auto Parts store, as of June 26, 2019.

Not so sure I would trust them with Service though, as I've heard and read the nightmarish stories about them.  Not too mention my lack of experience with the 'service guy,' Juan.  However, they do offer After Hours Vehicle drop off service, have substantial seating and a TV in the waiting area, and do have 12 repair bays.   Guess they can't be all that bad.  But 3.7 Stars?  I'll see if that goes up in the next few weeks/months.

It's hidden within the windy roads of Portola Valley so only those who ""know"" and ""care"" would ever find this place. The restaurant is in a corner, sort of a steakhouse feel, but then with rustic yet somewhat modern finish. Fits the redwoods surrounding the village.

Let's start with the fresh baked bread that comes out. Oh my god, this is so good. No garnish needed. Just bread and butter. It already puts you in a fantastic mood and we had a tough time resisting to dig for more lest we fill our stomachs.

We tried the margherita pizza, linguine vongole, ceasar salad with anchovies, chicken tenders and spaghetti with fries. All the food is prepared ""home-style"". It definitely is not garnished and visually overdone. It stays truthful to the dish and you can definitely feel the chef's love. The chick tenders are freshly hand-made as one can tell by the irregular yet non congealed texture. The linguine was made with fresh clams, but again, staying truthful to the ingredients and bringing out its flavor. The pizza was simple, yet effective.

This is Californian / American high-end comfort food at its best. It does not get better than this - starting from the atmosphere all the way to desert. The staff is friendly and professional and the food is cooked with a degree of professional homeliness. Top all of this with not-too-bad prices. Again, not cheap. But very reasonable.

The chef uses flavorful sauces with fresh ingredients, especially giving an extra attention to the fruits and vegetables that accompany each meat dish.

You can also get corn Colonel adorned with butter cheese in hot sauce in a cup known as esquite. But more importantly is the customer service.

First of all, I want to start off by giving a little bit of History background of the cemetery. This cemetery is controlled by the Holy Roman Catholic Church and it was established in the year 1800. Which makes it one of the oldest establishments in the San Fernando Valley. The name San Fernando comes from the king of Spain in the 16th century. Also, adjacent to the cemetery is the famous San Fernando Rey de Espana mission. Just one of the 21California Spanish missions established from the mid 1700's all the way up to the early1900's. Now the reason why the cemetery is very special to me is because my grandma, Ageda Montiel-Barraza, is buried here. And so is my uncle Javier Montiel.

Yeah there were a few days where there were closed and yes there was a few days where everything was out of stock essentially. But that's completely understandable especially because of the covid-19 pandemic. Target store does everything in order to maintain their employees safe in especially their customers. There is a limit amount of people that can shop at a certain time. But they do a very good job incorporating those rules for the CDC. I really appreciate the fact that this is Ash One Stop Shop in that if I want groceries or need medicine or need any type of apparel I can definitely find it at this Target store. As well as Electronics HomeGoods and pharmaceuticals. Customer service is great here. I have no complain about the employees. They seem reasonable and easy to work with on top of that they are very attentive to the customer needs. The store is very clean and is always stocked. The restrooms are kept especially cleaned during this era. But I do appreciate the fact that they remained open.

Located at Metbury Spring on the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad, Shoshone was founded in 1910 by Ralph Jacobus ""DAD"" Fairbanks. After the collapse of the mining camp of Greenwater (approximately 20 miles northwest of here), ""DAD"" Fairbanks came to Metbury Springs hoping to capitalize on the increased traffic through the area brought about by the railroad. Fairbanks, his sons and his son-in-law, Charlie Brown, moved the salvagable buildings and scrap from Greenwater to his new town of Shoshone. The town quickly prospered and soon a store was opened as well as an eatery for passengers on the T&T. In 1919 ""DAD"" moved on, leaving the operation of the town to Charlie Brown and his wife Stella. Shoshone continued to grow, adding a restaurant and two motels. Charlie Brown became an important figure in the region as well, representing Inyo, Mono and Alpine counties in the California State Senate. Upon his election, Charlie Brown handed management of the town over to his daughter and son-in-law, Bernice Brown-Sorrells and Maury Sorrells. Even after the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad discontinued operations in 1941, Shoshone continued to be an important hub in the eastern Death Valley country, serving travelers on highways 127 and 178.

Men and boys from California gradually replaced many of the early enrollees, who came from eastern states and were often unprepared for the isolation and homesickness.

Forget about ordering blue fin tuna. It was over double the price. Most of the roles were about $20 each. There were some for under $15 but these were your typical California roles etc.  Which usually go between $8-$10 an order at other restaurants.

As a lifelong movie fan, this is among my favorite movie theaters I've ever been to. It has that awesome retro feel that you get at small town movie theaters, but the difference is that this one is located right in The Castro, one of the most fun and vibrant neighborhoods of the city, and that its capacity is absolutely massive - it can seat a whopping 1,400 people! There is excellent sound quality, the screen is very big, and the seats are reasonably comfortable. The interior design is beautiful.

Tips: come here early, especially if you're coming to a movie's opening night, as there are no assigned seats and the line for concession and even the bathrooms can get ridiculously long before a sold-out screening. You can (and should) buy tickets online to make sure you get in.

They brought me a starter Caesar instead of the kale I ordered. The Caesar was so delicious I almost didn’t say anything, but my husband was eyeing it. I went ahead and told them of the mistake, and was able to enjoy both salads. The Caesar was actually a little better!

My husband had the crab cakes with slaw which were both amazing. I had the salmon with tartar sauce (perfect sauce and I had leftovers!) and broccoli. The broccoli was just okay - too heavy on the lemon so I barely ate it (and I love broccoli).

Sculptural neon sign projects from the face of the building, directly above the entrance.

The Pasadena Labor Temple is a simple, two-story, ochre-colored brick building. Fine detailing in the wrought iron ornamentation, the stair riser tiles, and in the carved stone plaque, finials and pilasters of the façade attests to the craftsmanship of the building. Built in 1931, at a time when the labor movement was gaining increasing recognition in this country, the Labor Temple stands as a reminder of the growth of the labor movement in that era as well as its place in civic life today. Building features a vintage sign projection over the centrally located entrance on the primary façade. Basement level and first-story windows are steel sash. In 1953, an additional wood-framed story was added to the roof, but set back from the original wall planes. In 1994, the building was rehabilitated and incorporated a larger, new housing project. The sign is designated as a significant object under the local historic preservation ordinance.",California,2020-02-16 00:09:50,5.0,Labor Temple,1,1,Other,148,380174.0,['Hindu temple'],Walnut,2020-02-16

Primary Architectural Style: Vernacular Masonry
Architect: Myron Hunt
Builder:	J.H. Woodworth and Son:
Context:	Period Revival Architecture

Roof mounted neon “Hotel Livingstone” sign is included in the City’s historic sign inventory. The building to which it is attached were rehabilitated in 2011 and received a Historic Preservation Award from the City’s Historic Preservation Commission.

Property is located on a rectangular shaped lot on the west side of South Los Robles Avenue, south of Green Street, within walking distance of the Civic Center and Paseo Colorado. Building is set closely to the street with a minimal setback and with the adjacent, separate, Stanley Apartments to the south, adjoins a narrow central courtyard landscaped with trees and groundcover. Property is generally flat and abuts other multi-family residential properties to the north and west. Livingstone Hotel, along with its adjacent twin, the Stanley Apartments, were formerly the two most massive buildings on the block, although they are now nestled among other similarly scaled buildings in a predominantly multi-family residential and commercial neighborhood.

The Livingstone Hotel is a three-story, symmetrical building with a modern penthouse and elevated basement, which shares a center courtyard with the Stanley Apartments, creating a symmetrical composition. The building is generally vernacular masonry construction, with some influence of the Italian Renaissance Revival style. The building is set closely to the street and is constructed of running-bond red brick on a concrete foundation. Elevated basement is fronted by a concrete trench and planter adjacent to the sidewalk. Central building volume is flanked by two smaller sub-volumes that are recessed behind the plane of the front façade. North elevation has three shallow, unadorned, rectangular bays, while the south courtyard-facing elevation has two. Building has gently sloping side-facing gables on the primary volume with red clay tile roofing, transitioning to a flat roof behind - pier-like heavy corners that appear as brick quoins. A shed dormer with a five-light fixed window is centered on the sloped roof of the main building volume. Multi-paned French doors with wrought iron balconies are found at the first floor, while the remaining windows are multi-paned, two-over-two, wood framed, double hung sash. Windows are slightly recessed with projecting, rowlock-course brick sills and flush, soldier-course brick lintels. Second and third floor recessed balconies have square openings.

Garden, designed by Florence Yoch & Lucile Council, has a fountain, a lawn, a gazebo, a rose garden, planting beds, retaining walls and mature trees.

Notes: Albert E. and Harriet Doerr (Harriet Huntington, granddaughter of Henry E. Huntington) were the second owners of the property beginning in 1941. Harriet Doerr lived at 494 Bradford until 2002. Doerr is a noted author who began writing in her early 70s and wrote Stones for Ibarra (1984), Consider This, Senora (1993), The Tiger in the Grass (1995).

Landscape – The main garden overall is asymmetrical in plan and is characterized by an axial north-south arrangement of a fountain, a lawn area and a gazebo at the western end. The garden also includes a rose garden; terraces formed by Arroyo stone or stacked broken concrete retaining walls; decomposed granite paths with brick edges; concrete and brick steps; planting beds defined by hedges, stones or brick retaining walls; and several mature trees. A substantial number of features of the original Florence Yoch design are intact in the front garden and some pathways, plantings and furnishings remain from the 1928 plan in the upper (back) garden. Although some major trees, shrubbery, flowers and tree groupings were part of the design, other plantings have been introduced or are extant because changes may have occurred while the garden was under construction, a practice for which the landscape designer was noted.

Nearly one-acre parcel is a hillside lot with a substantial topography change from the high point on the southeast corner to the low point on the northwest corner. House is sited on the higher ground of the southeast portion of the property with a paved driveway from Bradford Street to the detached garage at the south rear of the house separating the expanse of the front garden that is a major portion of the lot - sits at a 45-degree angle to the east property lot line. Property also includes a rear garden re-designed in 1956 by Florence Yoch and Lucile Council, Yoch’s long-time business partner and companion.

House/garage – Colonial Revival house is two stories with an irregular plan, gable roof, with a combination of wide wood clapboard and brick veneer siding. Entry is under a shed roof porch with square corner posts that is tucked into a corner formed by a projecting gable-roof wing of the right bay of the front elevation. The entry is accessed by a long flight of steps with a wrought iron handrail atop a concrete retaining wall that separates the driveway from the house. Georgian style, paneled front door with sidelights is recessed behind louvered shutters. Two wall dormers on the left bay wing have 6-over-6 double hung windows and louvered shutters. All windows on the first story are six-over-9 double hung windows with brick lintels and paneled shutters. Chimneys on the house side elevations are the same brick as used on portions of the exterior walls. Other details include a fan vent in the projecting gable on the front elevation and decorative cornice under the minimally projected eaves of the roof.  Garage has two-stories, 6-over-6 double hung windows, a heavy wood paneled garage door, wide clapboard siding and a gable wall dormer.",California,2020-02-15 19:51:42,5.0,"Ira Bryner Garden, 1928 - Architect: Roland Coate & Florence Yoch",1,1,Other,148,379741.0,['Historical landmark'],other,2020-02-15

It was good because the truffle scent was deep. Overall, it is very kind, but I think I should avoid taking excessive photos. Here, if you talk in advance, it would be okay to shoot even if it was limited. The atmosphere is Beverly Hills, so of course I like it!

Luxurious restaurant on scenic Irvine Laguna Beach. The surrounding scenery is so good that it's good for taking pictures. Go down the hill to Laguna Beach. The parking is mainly valet parking!

The staff in the store was very kind and friendly. There was a staff member who did a check in and gave us some rundown before coming into the building.

I heard about Prehistoric Pets ages ago and finally got the chance to visit with my son today.  It is in a plaza so there is plenty of free parking.  When you go in you are greeted by a large turtle enclosure next to giant tortoises in the pet shop section. To get into the Reptile Zoo adults have to pay $10 and kids over 4 pay $8.  There are additional add ones like feeding the turtles or taking s picture with a snake.

The Reptile Zoo is unbelievable!  It’s huge with enclosures large and small!  There are even a couple exhibits close to zoo quality. They have literally the largest snake I’ve ever seen. It just keeps going... it’s overwhelming!

There is a glass window giving you a view of their python breeding area. My imagination ran wild. Hundreds of GIANT snakes!  I heard from the employees that was nothing... they had tons of snakes back there.  I don’t know how I feel about all this. It’s clearly for profit and not to help the species.

There have been a lot of negative reviews about the conditions the animals on display are kept under and why I’ll not a reptile expert, I didn’t get that same feeling.  While there are TONS of animals, the ones I saw had plenty of room and had water in clean cages. One bit of proof was that this place didn’t smell which is amazing.  But again, I’m not an expert. All the animals in the zoo are not for sale, so I think there are a lot of rescues which I’m cool with.

The employees were nice about answering questions and there were A LOT of employees around. I could have stayed all day asking questions.

So on one hand this place gets a 5 star rating from a spectacle standpoint, the morality questions don’t allow me to give it a 6.  In fact, I may even decide (as I learn more) to chance my thoughts to a 1.  I just need to think more about it and maybe learn more. I WANT to say this is the coolest place ever! But honestly, my gut tells me that they’re profiting on the misfortune of these animals and that’s just not cool.  I’m telling myself the zoo are rescues, in which case my rating stands... but obviously the thousands of snakes they’re breeding in the back are another thing...

I entered in the back and walked through the bakery and German Food Store/deli to get to the restaurant. I love the ambiance which is exactly what you want from an establishment with this name. The food was excellent and reasonably priced. The staff is fantastic. I really enjoyed our waitress who was super friendly and informative.  We bought some apple strudel to go from the bakery and that woman was super friendly too.  Most of the other shops in the village were closed. I feel like this place is unfortunately passed its hay day... but who knows. I bet it gets pretty energized at night.

I wanted to stop on my way up originally, but the line was unbelievably long and just not worth it. Thankfully it was more reasonable on my way back and I was able to stop. The line moved pretty quickly and they had a mist machine over the line (which was nice, but a little too strong as it actually got our clothes a little wet). There are quite a few tables out front for eating.

The inside was pretty crowded and people weren't really following social distancing. Everyone was required to wear masks though.

The pastry and food are separate lines while the rest of the baked goods are all spread out around the store. There are no prices listed on or by the items, instead there are laminated sheets with prices listed so you need to know what the item you are interested in is called in order to know the price. All the pastries were unlabeled so I had to point and ask what something was and then check the price. This is not a great system because it takes a lot longer and then the lines are slower.

I'm not vegan or even vegetarian, but I've grown up around veggie meat. This was pretty good. Definitely not a perfect dupe for hamburger, but not bad. The fries were a huge portion. I didn't even come close to finishing them. I also tried a strawberry shake which definitely had the almond milk taste and was a little sweeter than I like, but also pretty good.

They rescheduled me twice. After the second I canceled my appointment and said I no longer wanted to see them. A month later I am billed for a ""no show"" even though I had canceled my appointment within the grace period, not to mention they rescheduled me twice. To make it worse I had an authorization code from my insurance company and told them what I needed only to find out they scheduled me with a doctor who doesn't use my insurance. I disputed the charge and my cc company agreed it was ridiculous. They are continuing to bill me eventhough I have called and told them what happened and have been assured they would stop. My bill has gone from $196.00 to $307.00. I am still fighting with them over what happened. Stay away from these people.

Update: after disputing all the charges with my bank, complaining to my Insurance company I have and cancelling my card I am finally rid of these awful people. My advice to anyone is to STAY AWAY! Worst company I have ever dealt with. I even complained directly to my credit card provider who said they would investigate.

Update #2 It has been over 2 years since I reviewed this business for terrible service and shady business practices. I finally get a response from the owner and this is all she has to say. ""You would have received a reminder call for the appointment.  It would be at that time you should have called us to let us know that you had cancelled your appointment and it would have been waived""
Obviously she didn't read what I had wrote because I canceled my appointment after they rescheduled me two separate times at last minute notice. The 3rd time they called I told them please cancel all servicies and was told OK only to receieve charges on my account at a later date with additional fees. To whomever the owner is.

I also tried the bangus with Mango Salsa. I brought in a co-worker of mine who was vietnamese and he killed 3 servings of rice. This is a must try if you're in the area.

We ordered the combo platter which fed my wife and I with plenty to spare. We also ordered hummus with pita bread and they come out hot. The pita bread was soft. I love the green chutney sauce which was vinegary so we put it on our salad. The tzatziki sauce was a great addition to the Beef and Lamb kabob.

My only gripe is that they do not do the chicken breast anymore. All the proteins are cut up into little chunks. I guess this was okay because it had small bits of charred pieces that were so flavorful and added another detention of texture.

Preferably standing on the foot board on the outside to feel the wind on your face. This is a fairly unique tourist experience and is also used by locals for public transport. The cable car can get really busy at either end of the major tourist line (from Powell/Market to Fisherman's Wharf) so I suggest riding early in the morning before the crowds build. I always like to ride outside the car on the centre so you can high five passengers coming the other way, it also means you don't have to worry about trucks getting a bit close on the other side. Its nearly as good as a rollercoaster ride on the San Francisco hills.

When we arrived they had to look up where the car was located. It was in a storage lot they have and it took them 45 minutes to bring it so we could test drive the extremely dirty car. It drove well but needed an alignment and at least 1 new tire. While we talked with the salesman they cleaned the car in the back. We negotiated the price and I clearly stated multiple times I didn't want anything added, just the car. The salesman refused to cross out the added options and just put a little line next to them all and stated that they would know that meant we didn't want them. When we left the sales desk and went to the financing office the guy rushed us through and just had me sign and initial everything without clearly explaining everything. After signing he said he was out of USB drives and would email me the contract. They only gave us 1 key and said they'd give us another during a week day when they could have it made. When we walked outside we were surprised to see the car had a lot of scratches and dings all over it, a glob of touch up paint on the nose and in two spots on either side of the rear plate (which have fallen off now exposing primer), the windshield had a little chip in it, and the glass roof looks like it's been through a sandstorm. They covered this cars big issues with dust and we had already signed everything so they said they would take care of these issues. I didn't receive an email with the contract and I couldn't get the finance guy on the phone they just said they'd leave him a message. I finally received an email but from them asking about my experience. I responded and asked to get my contract. They finally sent me an email with the contact over a month later but it was unable to open. I called and they stated they couldn't send me the contact so my wife had to go there. He first tried to tell her he couldn't print it now only when it was first signed, then a guy came in and showed him my email and he printed it right away. My wife had to mail it to me and it was all wrong. They added EVERYTHING to the contract which is why my payments are WAY more then they were supposed to be. We agreed on a final price at the sales desk and they changed it and rushed us through the signing process. They still have not given my wife the second key, fixed the paint, or the glass.

The order was ready so fast I couldn't believe it. The 2 drinks looked identical, but one said ""c & c"" in black marker, and the other one said ""c c.""  The drinks were ready so fast because they made 2 cookies and cream. No big deal right? My daughter does not like cookies and cream, nor was she looking forward to it. I think they should change the code they use for the two drinks so the person making the drinks doesn't easily get confused. This time and the last time we went the boba wasn't so great. We're probably going to stop coming here.

They did an exceptional job on the room. Very nice white and grey theme throughout. The room has a microwave and mini fridge which is a huge plus if ypu have kids or just want to store snacks. The new rooms come with a nice 50 inch t.v. the bathroom was nicely made and clean. They also added a roll down curtain to the window which is great for darkening the room and sleeping in. One of the best features of the property is its location. Right off the 5 freeway and very close to downtown burbank. Only reason we did not give 5 stars is lack of parking. Very small valet parking which is 18$ a day. However our stay was very pleasant and we look forward to coming back when the construction is done.,California,2018-03-11 18:05:06,4.1,Hampton Inn & Suites Los Angeles Burbank Airport,608,1,Other,205,70157.0,['Hotel'],Los Angeles,2018-03-11

They made sure they left our areas clean and free of any debris. They also made sure to be very profesional and let us know their progress and any things that came up that needed our attention.

As soon as we arrived at the order counter, I was going to say “Honey” and she was going to respond with “Hi.” And then I assumed that would get us a discount. It couldn’t have gone better. I said “Honey” and she said “Hi” which I immediately followed with “Do we get a discount.” Without missing a bit, the person behind the cash register said “Yes. You are the owner now.” Hurrah! We did it!

Honey Hi has nothing but gluten free items and no refined sugar. That means you don’ have to ask. It’s definitely gluten free. Don’t even bother. (We know we’ve all had that experience at the 99 Cents Only Store asking their stuff how much different items cost…just for fun.) EVERYTHING is gluten free…the breads, the toast, the pancakes. You’re good.

We had the Chocolate Shake - well our kid had it and he loved it.

I thought the coffee was pretty good.

I also had the Eggs and Toast (which incidentally was gluten free…) along with a side of Sweet Potato Hash. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the texture of the bread was, well, very bread-like.

I’m not a huge fan of sweet potatoes in place of where ‘regular’ potatoes should go (ie hash, fries, etc) so I didn’t necessarily love this so much, but my wife who IS a huge fan of sweet potatoes in place of where ‘regular’ potatoes should go loved it.

She had the Pesto Avocado Toast and was a big fan of that whole experience.

We also all shared the last available (at least the last visible available) chocolate chip cookie which we thought did a great job of pretending to be a non-gluten free cookie.

It’s a tiny place with very few tables…we had no problem finding one and this was during Sunday brunch time (high season for this kind of food) as many people were taking their food and drinks to go…so the size of the place wasn’t really an issue in practice for us.

As the new owners (hahaha, we’re kidding, see first paragraph if this is confusing) we are proud of the quality, presentation and taste of the food at Honey Hi.

There are great options here for vegetarians and gluten-free folks aloke. There are two different vegetarian tacos, both of which are delicious including the Ajo Seta Taco, which has a good portobello mushroom flavor to it (though I did lean towards adding salsa to it to give it more oomph. I’d also love cheese on this one.) AND the Verde Machina taco (possibly the most biologically steam-punk taco name ever) which also had good flavor, especially with lime squeezed on it. Nice and tangy!

You can get a taco plate  where you can mix any 3 tacos which then come with beans and rice. I did this and had the pinto beans which had a mild flavor and which were hearty.

The star of the meal, for me, was the Butternut Squash and Kale Quesadilla! (I’ve gone back and had these 2 more times since this first visit!) It has tons of flavor and it was certainly the best use of cheese in everything we ordered. It came with a very delicious salsa, and a vaguely Indian cream sauce which I loved.

The star of the meal for my wife, was the Chili-Lime Cucumber and Guacamole starter. She loves it.

Both of our dishes and the sides were beautifully presented with a little edible flowers, all kinds of delectable sauces, and were really just a pleasure to both look at as well as eat.

They also do a housemaid chips here. We have these a couple of times and both times we found them to be a little bit too thick for artists as well as (and again both times) a little bit over cooked for chips. The corn taste definitely came through by a single chip is a pretty heavy proposition here at Sol Bee

They have beers and siders on tap, and I had the Table Creek red wine blend which I found to be quite smooth and drinkable as blends tend to be.

We closed out our first meal at Sol Bee with their house-made Flan. This was incredibly “caramel-y” and by-far the best flan I've ever had, with dehydrated, cinnamon-sugar coated bananas on top. I'm not normally a flan guy, but this was outstanding.

Entire experience was topped off by serving staff who were among the nicest and sweetest people we've ever encountered. Well done Sol Bee. We’ll be back again and again.",California,2019-05-20 23:59:36,4.8,Sol Bee,38,1,Food & Beverage,78,181629.0,['Taco restaurant'],other,2019-05-20

Throw in free underground parking in the middle of Los Angeles and you have the recipe for the place that you should probably go and eat.

I've been doing a handful of their locations all over Southern California and I've noticed their menu changes seasonally. For example at another location I had a southern-style plate which no longer is on the menu. I was looking forward to eating it, but I am always impressed by a restaurant that changes their menu with the seasons, essentially offering you a new and fresh experience every time you go.

This time around, I had the Elated. (quick sidenote to mention that you have the potential to have a spiritual experience while ordering as you have the option of expressing who you are by the title of the food you choose for example, you don't just say “I'll have The elated”, you say ""I am elated"" and the server will know exactly what you mean and affirm your choice. Honestly sometimes I'm not really into that vibe and just want to order food and not have a forced spiritual intervention, and they don’t force it on you…but just be prepared for it if it’s not your vibe. The Elated was tempe enchiladas served under a mole sauce. This was super good and such a great treat to have a vegetarian mole sauce.

Our table also shared the coconut-based calamari appetizer. These are deep-fried and really tasty as well with a good and unique sauce. I've never had real calamari as I've been a vegetarian for so long, but this didn't taste like I was just eating flavored coconut. I really liked it.

Our 10-year-old was a bit hesitant about the whole menu as he still has a pretty simple powered, but he did love the smoky spicy but are not squash soup that he ordered.

I have the rose sangria to drink with my meal. It was delicious with grapefruit, rose wine, sage and agave. It was refreshing and not too sweet and very lovely.

We were there for a birthday celebration so it was unfortunate that they were out of most of their cake desserts, but we did have the raw “Almond Joy” bar which was good.

My wife, the birthday girl herself, enjoyed the ball and everything that she ate. In the end everyone was happy we had plenty of things to choose from and we loved the free parking.

We've been there a handful of times and order pizza from it as well through door dash and think the food is generally pretty good. You don't get much more San Fernando Valley old school then walking in to Lido's, even on the night we went, a Friday night in the rain which was as crowded as it could be. We also have enjoyed previously there curbside pick up, or actually there in parking lot pick up where you can order your food in advance, driving to the parking lot into a designated spot, call them, and they'll bring out your food as well as the credit card machine to charge you. At least that was great until they showed up on DoorDash which allows us to order from them without actually having to leave the house. Yay America!

If you're looking for classic Italian food served with generous portions found this is the place for you. They had house-made pastas, including a gluten-free pasta, and gluten-free pizza down if that's your desire.

I was really in the mood for a classic dish and got myself spaghetti with meatless red sauce. It had good flavor and the portion was generous. Though the pasta itself was slightly undercooked… A little more al dente then I would have liked it, which is a new experience for me with house-made pasta which I usually find to be pretty fresh.

My wife ordered pasta Primavera with their gluten-free pasta. She thought everything was overcooked including the pastor and the vegetables. She felt it needed some kind of fatty elements such as oil or more butter or something. She was disappointed.

Our 10-year-old add plain spring-shaped pasta which he liked a lot.

The sourdough dinner rolls were awesome and especially good with the butter they came with.

I also got myself a glass of the house Chianti which was good and very generously poured.

We also ordered a cheese pizza, medium sized so my kid and I could enjoy a couple slices with our pasta and have the full Lido, classic Italian experience. I've noticed with many pizza places there is a tendency to not put enough sauce on, so I asked the waitress about this at the beginning, not wanting to get, per se, extra sauce, just wanting to make sure there was enough sauce on the pie to actually taste it. She assured me that they usually put a generous amount of sauce on the pie so I ordered it as is. When it came it had hardly any sauce at all on it it was disappointing and we sent it back. The crust itself was more ""bready"" then “pizza-crusty”, which, was not my preference for a pizza crust. All in all that was disappointing.

So overall it was a bit of a mixed experience for us. We like the atmosphere… And when were in the mood for a classic Italian place this is a fun place to go with generally good food. I definitely would specify extra sauce for a pizza in the future, and my wife has high hopes that they wouldn't overcook everything that they served next time along.",California,2019-04-30 18:30:43,4.7,Lido Pizza,1018,2,Food & Beverage,78,44507.0,['Pizza restaurant' 'Italian restaurant' 'Restaurant'],other,2019-04-30

We love vegetarian restaurants where we don't have to ask if anything on the menu is vegetarian because, everything is! We also love Indian food, so it was a no brainer to give this place a try. Generally speaking we enjoyed the food, though we found it to be a little spicier than we wanted it to be. Often at Indian restaurants the server will ask you to specify how spicy you want your food…they didn’t here and though that might work for some folks, we definitely found some of the dishes too spicy to be able to adequately enjoy. It looked like most other diners were folks from India so kudos to Swagatham for creating an authentic Indian experience that attracted people who grew up eating this cuisine!

Unfortunately the service was extraordinarily frustrating and a bit weird which lead to a very difficult dining experience for the 7 of us and an overall impression of us not wanting to come back. For example they didn’t bring plates to us. They didn’t bring serving utensils with the items we ordered. We had to ask several times for plates and place settings while food sat in front of us with no way to serve it.

We also ordered quite a few dishes and they seemed to lose track of them as we had to keep asking for ones that hadn’t arrived. (Including their signature indli rice dish which was the very first thing we ordered and didn’t come til the very end after many reminders.) At one point our server asked us if we wanted anything else when we hadn’t yet received everything we had already ordered.

Towards the end of our meal, when I guess it “looked” like we might be finishing, they brought another party over to the table where our kids were sitting as if they expected our kids to get up and leave so this other group could sit down.

One or two mistakes in service can be forgiven or even ignored, but when we went without all of our food, had to ask several times for place settings and things to serve the food with, and then end experience of having to let them know we weren’t finished yet as they seemingly expected our kids to vacate their table for another party led to a situation where, regardless of how much we enjoyed the food, the surreally weird service was the overwhelming takeaway of the experience.

Regarding the food - The presentation great. Everything we were brought looked good and despite some of it being a little too spicy, it tasted great too.

The signature Indli Rice Cake dish, was nicely presented but the rice cakes themselves didn’t taste like much without their accompanying dipping sauces.

The saag Panner tasted great too (although too spicy for our tastes) The spinach was a very present fresh flavor.

We especially loved the dosas. They were super-tasty, especially the cheese one. (Though we think it was cheddar cheese on inside which we liked, but which didn’t feel so authentically Indian.)

We also had samosas (tasted good but too spicy), spinach pakora (which looked and tasted great), and a fried/battered cauliflower dish which didn’t have much taste without the dipping sauces.

If we lived in Woodland Hills I’d consider giving the good another try via take-our or delivery, especially if we could specify the spice-level on some of the dishes, but after the service issues, I don’t see us rushing back for a dine-in experience here.",California,2019-03-15 18:54:47,4.0,Swagatham Vegetarian Cuisine,93,1,Food & Beverage,78,70289.0,['Indian restaurant'],other,2019-03-15

There was no line at Greenleaf on Saturday night, when we were there, to order at the counter and plenty of available seating in the brightly lit dining room in the back, as well as in the more comfortably lit bar area behind the counter and bar. We were looking for a more traditional order from the waiter at a table experience, but we were pleasantly surprised by the awesome quality and taste of the food that we received at this counter order joint.

I ordered from the build your own entrée menu, and chose marinated tofu as the main, along with faro risotto, and green beans with shallots as my two sides. Everything on the plate was truly delicious. The tofu had a nice charr to it and, although I would have liked the marinade it was cooked in to be a little bit more present, it's still had a decent and satisfying flavor.

The faro risotto was absolutely the star of the plate with a very nice savory cheese flavor running through it. The green beans, especially mixed with the shallots tasted, great as well. The green beans were perfectly cooked too - just as crispy/fresh as I like them to be.

My wife had the La La bowl with faro, quinoa and vegan nacho cheese which she thought was very good, filling bowl, and delicious. It also contained quinoa, black beans, corn, tomato, avocado and baby kale, along with a dressing that a little bit of a spicy kick to it.

There are plenty of other vegetarian options to choose from including seasonal specials like baked butternut mac & cheese, paleo cauliflower rice, salads, bowls, a flatbread and much more. So if you're a vegetarian you're definitely not going to go hungry here at The Green leaf Gourmet Chopshop.

They also have seasonal cocktails and, unfortunately, they were out of the Apple Caramel Mule which is what I wanted, and which sounded absolutely delicious. That was a bit of a bummer since it was fairly early on a Saturday night that they were already out of this particular item. I still wanted a cocktail though and ended up with the Fig and Lemon. This is made with fig jam, and bourbon. It was sweet-ish and well mixed, with a little bit of the visual element of, what I'm guessing were, seeds from the fig jam mixed in with it. It did the job it was supposed to and made me happy.

The service was also very quick which was unfortunately for us a requirement of the evening as we had to be an event with a hard start time (which is why we didn't end up waiting for a table at the nearby restaurant that we first went to.) Though it was slightly awkward that the food came out before the cocktail. I would imagine most people, myself for sure, would want to start on the cocktail and enjoy that in a leisurely fashion before the food comes out. Also the bar table we sat and wasn't clean and had food on it, but it was the only available table in the bar area so it's where we chose to say it. The dining room in the back had plenty of seating but it was way too brightly lit for dinner, we thought. It took us a while to get the attention of someone to clean the table for us, and when they eventually did they actually didn't do a very thorough job and left bits of food from the previous diners right in front of me on the table top. That was disappointing and I ended up just cleaning it myself with a napkin, and it didn't really affect my enjoyment of the food.

There are some great restaurants on Abbot Kenny - some super fine dining and popular options which we love to eat at, but in a time crunch and knowing that we’ll get delicious food with lots of vegetarian, and gluten-free options, we wouldn't hesitate to come to Greenleaf Gourmet Chopshop again.",California,2019-02-11 22:18:35,4.3,Greenleaf Chopshop,578,2,Food & Beverage,78,5775.0,['Health food restaurant' 'Brunch restaurant' 'Californian restaurant'],other,2019-02-11

We were seated fairly quickly despite the fact that the restaurant was super busy and filled with Van Nuys locals.

We had basic breakfast stuff done absolutely the way it should've been done. I had two eggs and French toast. I had them make the eggs with egg whites, and they were scrambled perfectly and especially tasty with the cheese and onions I had them add. The French toast was also perfect.

I also had a side of hashbrowns. They looked dry but they actually tasted great. Crispy on the outside and cooked all the way through, nice soft potatoes on the inside.

The coffee was OK. Definitely better than the thin “brown water” I've had at some American restaurants where they really don't know what they're doing in terms of coffee, but this definitely could have been stronger. I love a good strong cup of coffee and I'm always a little bit disappointed when I’m brought coffee at a breakfast restaurant that doesn't give me a nice bold punch in the face at my first sip. (To be fair it did taste a little better after having some of the sweetness of the French toast and syrup taste in my mouth…Ahh chemistry what can't you fix?)

We would definitely come again when in the mood for a basic breakfast.

Would Nat’s West live up to the quality we’d come to expect from their sibling in the east? For the most part yes!

We headed to Nat’s West late one Sunday morning where we were greeted with the familiar crowds waiting to get seated. That’s a good sign, especially at a breakfast place. It didn’t take all that long for them to find room for us and pretty soon the coffee arrived. This was probably my only disappointing part about the experience. The other location (and I’m not sure if they’re actually connected anymore) does coffee exactly right, very bold, never thin tasting. The roast I got here was on the thin side. Acceptable, but not the “wow this is great coffee” level that I’m hoping for.

It got much better from there. I had two eggs (whites) scrambled with cheddar cheese and a side of perfectly cooked hash browns. It’s a basic breakfast fantasy and they did it perfectly…hash browns crispy on the outside, and fully cooked and soft on the inside. The egg whites were perfect too.

I also had what they call a carrot muffin (though fans of the other location will know it as the Morning Glory Muffin…this leads me to believe these 2 locations don’t talk anymore.) The muffin tasted similar but was slightly overbooked…a little denser than I wanted it.

Two other folks in the party got the Special Green Omelet with home fried potatoes.  The omelet was full of greens, topped with avocado and yummy…and the home fried potatoes were also done just as perfectly as the hash browns I got.

Our kid got the Bananas Foster French Toast which also was done perfectly and tasted pretty sinfully good.

I’d heard about this place for years…I’d even driven by it once or twice…So fueled by a recent memory of a guava and cheese pastry in Florida at a Cuban Cafe, my tongue was already pre-salivating as we finally got the chance to check it out.

It was a completely satisfying and indulgent experience for me, my wife, and our 10 year old.

So the lines are long and confusing, especially as a first timer. Our goal was to order breakfast food (which they serve ’til 11am sharp) and we arrived at about 10:30 and we’re getting a little paranoid that we wouldn’t make it to the front of the line before 11. They had a staff member stationed at the door guiding people where to go but here’s the rundown to help you figure it out. Once you get in, if you want to eat in and order prepared foods (sandwiches, breakfast, soup etc) go to line on left to order from Cafe / Cashier where also some “favorites” pastries are available. If you want to order form the full bakery menu (all cakes, pastries savory and sweet, and breads) go to line on right but you won’t be able to order cafe food there. There’s also a separate ‘drinks only’ line available. We wanted to both eat and sea the extensive bakery menu so we went to the cafe and “favorites” line to order, we ate, and then we wandered through the larger bakery display area just to get the full visual experience of what they had to offer.

We did end up getting to the front of the line by 11 so we didn’t miss breakfast (it felt like they were a little flexible with that though I’ve seen other reviews which said that people had experienced a sharp cutting off of breakfast at 11 so I guess it’s a little bit of a dice roll and, if you want breakfast, get there early)

My wife had the omelet platter which she loved, especially the avocado and tomato on the eggs. It looked great with the accompanying potatoes (which she thought were a little greasy) mixed with onions and peppers, and greens. It normally comes with cheese, but she eat’s mostly vegan and they were happy to not include that per her request.

Luckily all the pastries we wanted were “favorites” so we weren’t lacking at all in the Cafe line. We shared a couple of “Rellenitas"" These are on their “savory” menu but the plantains made this nicely sweet…This was very similar to what they called a “croquete” at a Cuban cafe we had just visited in Florida, and it was awesome.

We’re all vegetarians so were very happy to see a vegetarian version of their “potato balls” in the form of the “Cheese and Spicy Pepper Potato Ball”. This was also like a Croquete, coated and tasted great! Even our 10 year old liked it and he doesn’t usually go for anything with a complex flavor profile.

I opted for their Saturday soup of the day (forgoing breakfast altogether) which was the Corn Poblano Soup on a bread bowl. (They sometimes have Cream of Leek soup, and another vegetarian option.) This tasted amazing and the sourdough bread bowl, baked in house, it was served in was perfect.

We also had a Guava and Cheese Strudel - This was the authentic, exact taste I was looking for after eating it twice at Cuban places in Miami. I loved it in its flaky pastry housing. Why did it take so many decades for me to discover the glory that is mixing guava and cheese?!

Our kid loved the mango turnover he got. but not the side of potatoes.

I had a Cortadito (they say it’s like a macchiato) to drink. I’m used to Cuban coffee drinks served sweet so was surprised this wasn’t. This was good, but kind of just a regular espresso drink, tempered with a little bit with milk. I need to ask next time what a traditional sweet Cuban coffee is in their minds so I can order it.

Oh there will be a next time. This was and indulgent and awesome experience. Prepare to wait in lines. Prepare for that wait to be worth it. We loved it.",California,2019-01-18 20:17:22,4.7,Porto's Bakery and Cafe,9998,1,Food & Beverage,78,743.0,['Bakery' 'Cafe' 'Coffee shop'],Burbank,2019-01-18

Well, shut my mouth I was wrong. We headed to Marmalade for dinner one night, just on the strength that they offered the Impossible Burger (super good “meat-like” vegetarian burger) and were pleasantly surprised at how accommodating and good all the options were for my vegetarian and my wife’s gluten free diets.

The menu was a a lot more modern than I remember it being the last time I was there (honestly probably more than a decade ago) and all of the vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options are helpfully labeled right on the menu. They’ve put some thought into this!

They have two, count ‘em TWO types of veggie burgers available (including the aforementioned Impossible Burger which is really tasty though not gluten free.)

Four, count ‘em FOUR of their soups were vegetarian as well. I had a bowl of the split-pea as my main which was very tasty. I didn’t need to embellish it with salt or pepper which often happens with restaurant soups. It was blended smooth and I might have liked it with a little more texture .

My wife had the Grilled Veggie salad which caused her, a true connoisseur of organic, farmers market produce, to say that she was in “grilled vegetable heaven”. It was also served warm which was lovely on a cold-coldish winter night. (Imagine carrots, asparagus, onions, tomatoes, and portobello mushrooms along with lettuce. (And they subbed goat cheese for the feta it normally came with. She loved it.

They also gave paper straws with the beverages…the whole no-plastic straw thing is relatively new and for a fairly mainstream place like Marmalade to offer the more environmentally paper straws…well, we were impressed.

Good for the price of course.

The Grocery Outlet is able to sell food at a discount for various reasons – it might be surplus stock, a product with old packaging, a new product that’s being tried out, or in some cases products that are slightly imperfect or getting close to their expiration dates. It has grown quite a following and the “Gross Out” as it has affectionately nicknamed has become a destination for bargain hunting. I also enjoy shopping there because of the unpredictability of what I might find.

The Richmond store is one of my favorite Grocery Outlets (the newer store in Alameda ties for first place). Anytime I’ve been there (even during the Covid lockdown) the vibe has been pretty chill. It feels a bit more spacious than some of the other stores and I like how they group most of the healthy and organic food together. I’ve also had a good success rate with picking up nice things there – my latest find, last week, was a 2.5 lb vegan Holiday Roast from Gardein (normally $20) for $6! There’s always plenty of parking and staff members are friendly. On recent trips, I’ve picked up:

•	Many vegetarian and vegan meat substitutes from Quorn, Gardein, Field Roast, and others
•	Plant-based alternatives to butter and cheese, including Miyoko’s and Milkadamia
•	Plant-based milks, including Oatley, Ripple, and Hope & Sesame
•	Snacks like cassava chips, vegan puffs, seeds and nuts
•	Wine from Napa, Sonoma, Paso Robles and Lodi
•	Local chocolate from Charles Chocolate and Ocho

There are a lot of people in the US who can’t afford quality food and places like the Grocery Outlet allow them to buy organic or plant-based food at discount prices. Once the economic impact of Covid-19 starts to really take effect then affordable food will become paramount.

Overall, I think that the Grocery Outlet deserves 4/5 Green Stars for social and environmental impact, based on these factors:

•	Stocking food that would otherwise be in danger of being tossed out because of packaging changes, overstock, imperfections, or looming expiration dates, is part of a solution to the huge problem of food waste. According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, 30 percent of food is wasted globally across the supply chain, contributing 8 percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions. If food waste were a country, it would come in third after the United States and China in terms of impact on global warming.
•	Stores have been trending towards stocking more plant-based and organic food.
•	The Grocery Outlet stocks a good number of brands that rate well, ethically.
•	A good number of these brands are also smaller, local companies.
•	On Glassdoor you can get a feel for how happy employees are at the Grocery Outlet. The average rating for Grocery Outlet is a decent 3.4 out of 5 but the stores are independently owned so experiences vary. For example, an employee at a San Francisco store mentions good benefits including full health insurance, while employees at other stores seem to receive minimum wage and no benefits. So it’ll vary from store to store.
•	They have an annual Independence from Hunger campaign that raises funds or food donations for local shelters and food banks.

I just wrote a post on the Grocery Outlet on my ethical consumerism blog, the Green Stars Project, if you’d like to read more (greenstarsproject.org).",California,2020-05-15 22:03:59,4.4,Grocery Outlet,874,1,Food & Beverage,107,84522.0,['Grocery store' 'Fruit and vegetable store' 'Health food store'],Richmond,2020-05-15

This was a very brief visit while I waited for a friend to go for a walk around Piedmont Cemetery on a sunny Friday afternoon. What better way to spend a Friday afternoon? I’m so glad that I stopped in at the Ride Bar because it was a very pleasant experience. I asked for an oat milk chai and have to say that it’s probably the best chai that I’ve ever had – certainly top three. I think that it’s homemade since the mix was in a jug (rather than a package) in their fridge. It was actually the barista’s first time making a chai, so a great success all round. I also bought an apple and that’s also noteworthy: almost the only time I’ve ever bought a piece of fruit at a café.  They coaxed me over to the healthy side with their cunning omission of pastries from the menu. Their main food offerings are fruit/granola bowls (yes, including acai) and oatmeal. They are focused on smoothies, but don’t ignore their killer chai. Nice counter spaces with Wi-Fi and power outlets and also some outdoor seating.

I’m giving Ride Bar 5/5 “green stars” for social and environmental impact, based on the following:

•	Almost all plant-based. Vegans: just check for honey.
•	Almost all made from scratch (down to the nut butter).
•	Coffee from Highwire and tea from Blue Willow
•	The menu says “Organic and Woman Owned” at the top but it wasn’t clear which ingredients are organic (besides the oats which are listed as organic on the menu). Would be good to get some clarity on that as it’s a prominently displayed selling point. Giving the benefit of the doubt for now ;)
•	Woman-owned business.
•	Waste reduction: they have mason jars prominently displayed at the counter, on sale for $3 each.

First off, I love the name – it reminds me of the pretty, pretty funny TV show, Red Oaks. There has been so much build up to Boichick opening (at least in my head, because it walked by frequently as they got ready to open) that I was excited to finally try it out. Ordering experience was fine – a little awkward and rushed, but my life is full of awkward experiences, so it was probably just me. It’s $3 per bagel, sans toppings of any kind, so I curbed my enthusiasm and ordered only two – an everything and a pumpernickel with salt and caraway seeds. By the way, a Buddhist monk walked in ahead of me and asked: Can you make me one with everything?  Ok, that didn’t really happen, it’s a joke. Think about it. Anyhoo, I toasted both bagels at home and topped with heirloom tomatoes and while the Pumpernickel wasn’t as exciting as I’d hoped, the Everything bagel was among the best bagels that I’ve had. I would pay $3 again for that one, once in a while.

I’m also giving the Boichik 4/5 “green stars” for social and environmental impact, based on this:

•	Their flour is Organic High Mountain from Central Milling in Petaluma.
•	All other bagel ingredients are also organic.
•	All bagels are vegan and they offer Kite Hill vegan cream cheese as a topping.
•	According to their site: All other ingredients are sourced with an eye towards sustainability, local, seasonal, and organic as conditions and availability permit.
•	An observant reviewer pointed out that their regular cream cheese is Philadelphia brand – they could do a bit better there.
•	Bagels were handed over in an unbleached, recycled (40% post-consumer) brown paper bag.

Shadowlands is a spark of life on the quiet end of College Avenue, offering a selection of interesting books to read or buy and a café menu replete with both familiar and more unusual offerings. I felt that Christmas had come early (or late) when I ordered a homemade mochi muffin and Lou brought over a plate with three of them! Freshly toasted! For $2.50! Living in the Bay Area this long had set my expectations so that $2.50 for one little mochi muffin seemed perfectly reasonable – a bargain, even. I think Lou, the owner, likes to subvert these expectations. It’s nice to have a good selection of things to eat, from avocado toast to strawberry shortcake, and I’ve come to appreciate Lou’s spin on food.

The music selection is good and it’s not so loud that it’s in your face (hello, Starbucks!) and there’s a good amount of seating in the sunny window or in the main body of the café. There’s also fast Wi-Fi and many power outlets available so that you can write your novel, uninterrupted ;) Lou organizes an assortment of regular events, which you can find on the Shadowlands website. I’ve yet to make it one, but they look interesting, ranging from author talks to role-playing and improv parties!

Note: the café was closed yesterday (Feb 2nd) and there’s a sign in the window that Shadowlands will be closed for February for spring cleaning.

I’m also giving the Shadowlands 5/5 “green stars” for social and environmental impact, based on this:

•	Lou stocks no disposable coffee cups. You can either bring your mug or have your drink in-house.

Normally I would go through a bunch of factors to make up the ethical (green stars) rating – the coffee, the food, social impact, etc. In this case, I just want to emphasize the one point above: Lou has taken the brave step to open a café where there are no to-go cups available. We throw away millions of to-go cups every day, and most of them end up in an incinerator or landfill after enjoying about 15 minutes of useful life. Some customers will no-doubt turn around and walk out when they find out that they can’t take their coffee away in a plastic-lined disposable cup. But that’s how you create social change – people will get used to this. Blue Bottle just announced plans to launch zero-disposable stores, and Dominique Crenn’s upcoming café in the Salesforce tower will do the same. We should applaud and support Lou for being one of the first to take this step, and not even making a fuss about it.

There’s a lot of seating (including outdoor) but like most Starbucks these days there are no power outlets. Indoor and outdoor seating gets lots of sun exposure.  Free parking all day in the parking lot. Music quality at Starbucks has gone downhill lately (lots of insipid EDM) and unfortunately they keep the volume really high in this store, so it’s oppressive at times.

I’m also giving Starbucks 2/5 “green stars” for social and environmental impact, based on the following pros and cons:

Pros:
•	Decent benefits for staff. In the US, employees are eligible for coverage of a bachelor’s degree.
•	Starbucks is committed to hiring 100,000 Opportunity Youth by 2020.
•	Starbucks announced a plan to hire 10,000 refugees in response to Trump’s proposed Muslim travel ban.
•	Diversity. E.g., Starbucks covers health insurance coverage for partners in lesbian and gay relationships.

Cons:
•	Starbucks haven’t published prices paid for green coffee since 2011. Indications are that their CAFE purchasing standards are inferior to fair trade or good direct trade practices.
•	Animal welfare: The Business Benchmark on Farm Animal Welfare gave Starbucks the second lowest ranking.
•	Food waste: All of the food in their pastry case is for display only – it will be thrown away after a few days.
•	Plastic waste 1: most of their food items are individually-wrapped in plastic (they are unwrapped and then served in a paper bag).",California,2019-03-23 23:48:38,3.8,Starbucks,388,2,Food & Beverage,107,85222.0,['Coffee shop' 'Breakfast restaurant' 'Cafe'],Alameda,2019-03-23

Downsides first: the layout could be improved and the young chap who served me was a bit surly – but neither of these things bothered me (and the chap was fast :). The coffee and pastries were both very good and I’m wavering between 4 and 5 stars, but I’m going to go for 5 stars because prices were reasonable and it’s really one of the best places that I know of within a radius of a 2 or 3 miles – that’s the approx. distance to La Farine or Timeless Coffee ;) And speaking of La Farine, I think my plain croissant from L’acajou was every bit as good as theirs. (Perhaps Andrew C. visited on an off-day.) Their cookies were pretty good, but the standouts for me were the cheddar chipotle biscuit and the banana bread – both very memorable. Also – organic, fair-trade coffee for around $2? Yes please!

I’m also giving them 4/5 Green Stars for social and environmental impact, based on these reasons:
•	Nomadic Coffee: All of the coffee is organic, most is fair trade certified, and some is even Smithsonian bird-friendly (that’s pretty much the highest sustainability standard for coffee). Nomadic seem like a good bunch.
•	Waste minimization at L’acajou was pretty good. I had my own cup but forgot to notice if there was a cup discount.
•	Decent selection of vegetarian options, and a vegan salad.
•	They do seem to use organic quinoa and greens for some of their veggie options.",California,2018-05-28 20:00:23,4.1,L'ACAJOU Bakery and Cafe,138,1,Food & Beverage,107,85271.0,['Cafe' 'Bakery' 'Restaurant'],Oakland,2018-05-28

I picked up three bags of Wholesome Bakery sandwich cookies at Berkeley Bowl to share at work. They were a little pricey (about $8 per bag) but considering that they are high-end cookies, locally made from sustainable ingredients, I figured it was worth a try. After all, walk into Starbucks and a single mediocre cookie will cost you about $3. These cookies are so much better, and they are also vegan. I’m pretty sure that everyone at work liked them (10 people, three flavors of cookie) so that seems to be a good endorsement. I’m not sure which was my favorite (maybe the caramel) so it looks like I’m going to have to try them all again!

I’m also giving them 5/5 Green Stars for social and environmental impact, based on these reasons:
•	All organic ingredients.
•	Completely vegan – no eggs or dairy.
•	Packaging is fairly minimal, a paper bag with what appears to be a cellophane lining (which is compostable or recyclable, since cellophane is cellulose-based and similar to paper).
•	They work with suppliers that have high standards as far as social and environmental impact goes. For example, Giusto’s grain, Wholesome Sweeteners, and Santa Cruz Organic.
•	I normally avoid palm oil, but theirs is certified by Palm Done Right, a new certification for palm oil that’s organically grown by small farmers in Ecuador and West Africa, who receive fair trade pricing and community support.
•	I’ve done a lot of research into palm oil (about to publish a post on the topic on the Green Stars Project) and really, Palm Done Right is the only certification that seems to actually work (RSPO is not working out).

Friendly barman and good atmosphere (although too many TV screens for my liking).

I’m also giving them 3/5 Green Stars for social and environmental impact, based on these reasons:
•	My main problem was that, while Guinness was served in a proper glass, the Anchor and IPA were served in plastic cups (with Bud Light logo). WHY? Update from owner, Odie: they only do this on their two busiest weekends (during Outside Lands and Hardly Strictly).
•	The barman was helpful in explaining that the curry sauce was not vegetarian, so we ended up with the cheese toasty and fries, being almost the only veggie things on the menu.

Today is the official opening of Timeless and coffee drinks are free all day! I’ve been twice so far and both times have had the Tofurkey sausage roll because it’s that good. I’m partial to sausage rolls and find that it’s hard to find a good vegetarian one in the US. Tofurkey is easier to digest than Field Roast (gluten) or dense sausages made from soy protein isolate. The pastry is also great – you would never know that it’s vegan. My (free) latte today was good and a shared donut was also delicious: fluffy and not greasy. The house coffee yesterday was also quite good – the almond milk did coagulate a little bit in the hot coffee, so an alternative milk for use as a “creamer” may be good – would love to see them using homemade hazelnut milk (which doesn’t coagulate in hot coffee) or maybe Ripple. All in all, Timeless is a great little café, very cheerful space and staff members and wonderful selection of all-vegan pastries.

I’m also giving them 5/5 Green Stars for social and environmental impact, based on these reasons:
•	EVERYTHING IS VEGAN – no worrying about whether they source humane milk or butter, because they don’t use any of it!
•	It’s the kind of place where you have your coffee in ceramic cup (or bring your own to-go cup) but if you do forget to bring one, all of their cups and lids are compostable.
•	Everything else is ceramic or metal with minimal waste generation. Items like yogurt also come in compostable packaging.
•	Coffee sourcing: On the website they say that “We could bore you with details about how we ensure that our coffees are ethically sourced… but who has time for all of that? You sure don’t.” That’s not true – if I’m on your website I want to learn something about your coffee sourcing. People are starting to make time to educate themselves so that they can make ethical choices, and the social and environmental side of coffee is important.
•	As mentioned above, I would love if they used homemade (vegan) milk. I don’t love the cartons that Pacifica milk comes in (mix of paper, plastic, and aluminum) because it’s hard to do anything with them after use.
•	Although there’s some room for improvement I’m giving Timeless 5/5 green stars for showing how an all-vegan café is possible – and to show that vegan pastries can be good enough to make everyone happy : )

I think I’ve tried a good percentage of the breweries in the Berkeley-Oakland area. Gilman is now a firm favorite (along with Hoi Polloi and the Torpedo room). While nearby Fieldwork has a pretty seating area, Gilman definitely ranks significantly higher in my book for the beer itself (and friendliness). There’s an emphasis on saisons, farmhouse ales, stouts and the use of fruit, chili, chocolate and some alternative yeasts (like Brettanomyces and saison yeast). Food trucks on weekends, restaurant in the works, and outside food welcome. I liked everything we tried, but especially the Cheval de Fer (dry-hopped Belgian saison) and the Champ Rochaux (saison with nectarines). Going back soon – there’s a Groupon available now too!

I’m also giving them 4/5 “green stars” for social and environmental impact, based on these reasons:
•	Beer is brewed on site, reducing the carbon and material footprints (transportation and packaging).
•	I believe they’ll fill growlers and crowlers to-go, again reducing packaging.
•	You can bring your own food (Whole Foods is across the street), thereby accommodating all diets.
•	Close to public transport.
•	They have (or had) a promotion where for every pint of Cheval de Fer bought, $1 is donated to ALS research.
•	I didn’t find out that much about their ingredients yet – will update if I do.",California,2017-08-25 21:06:46,4.6,"Gilman Brewing Company, Brewery, Berkeley, East Bay, CA",198,2,Food & Beverage,107,5858.0,['Brewery' 'Bar' 'Beer garden'],Berkeley,2017-08-25

Took it to go so it came out to 4 boxes that I took home. I ordered through phone both the female employee and the gentleman I spoke to where very nice. Place looks very nice and higher upscale compare to your traditional pizza places. Outdoor seating looks great as well if there was more like a rope of warm white light that may turn it to looks more romantic as the layout of the outdoor seating looks as such anyway. Overall was rather surprised how pleasant it was from a phone call to pick up and paying. Will come back again :)  this time to eat there with my family to see how the service is in person.,California,2020-02-24 03:21:52,4.3,Popolo's Pizza,518,2,Food & Beverage,126,86137.0,['Pizza restaurant' 'Italian restaurant'],Fresno,2020-02-24

* Excellent location on the East bay area. Close to 680 and with Iron horse trail so close that  you can bike or walk to the new shopping center. It also has a market place  just 5 min walking with good restaurants like Thai, Indian or Chicken wings Also I recommend Hopyard bar, on Thursdays they have Pliny the elder beer.
*Staff so friendly and helpful. We had one incident at the beginning of our lease, and Nicoya and her team helped us and followed the incident until it was solved. It  was something that we really appreciated.

Served hot, still simmering when served with all the traditional ingredients, asada, chicken, chorizo, nopal, queso, avocado, green onions, and salsa.

It did have all the usual items of a traditional molcajete, but it was served in a plastic molcajete, which made the food comd faster and with dirty romaine lettuce leaves stuck in the top.

The flowers and plants were beautifully lit up! The lighting was really well done and extremely colorful. The lights gave a new perspective to viewing flowers. However, it was crowded inside (the aisles are narrow). Some people walked through quickly. One family even took photos almost like a photo shoot, holding up areas or getting in your view. As for the event itself, I would say it was managed ok. It felt kind of new, not thoroughly planned. The play area outside was not worth visiting and the shop was more like a mini booth. There weren't many food choices. There was a grilled cheese stall that made the shop filled with smoke from the grill. Overall the conservatory was gorgeous and worth viewing/admiring. I give 5 stars because the main event (lit flower viewing) was beautiful and because there is a lot of good potential for the event to improve for next year.",California,2020-01-13 07:54:31,4.7,Conservatory of Flowers,1766,1,Other,145,2859.0,['Botanical garden' 'Historical landmark' 'Museum'],San Francisco,2020-01-13

I am always in Burbank and constantly meeting up with friends to catch dinner and a movie. We have our usual spots but we are always looking to try something new. For me since I cook and have cooked professionally for so long I love days when I can relax, order food and be waited on.

I read the yelp reviews and although there are a few bad reviews most were good and the food looked good. So we decided tonight would be the night. Nora B was our server, she was very welcoming and friendly. She took our order with a smile and although not everyone thinks this is a big thing I am finding the finer art of customer service to be hard to find lately. The staff beginning with the host are you first contact with the restaurant. Their attitude can effect your visit very easily.

My wife and I both ordered the lamb. I ordered mine rare and she ordered hers medium well. We both loved our food, I mean everything on our plate was delicious. My one and only problem was that pita and hummus was not included. Although I joined the reward program which got us a free order of pita and hummus. They were excellent! Something about warm pita and hummus when done right is so satisfying.

Finally as for our service. Our waitress was busy and I could see that, she scurried from table to table taking orders. Yet we weren’t ignored, this is very important! The support staff was there to help. A bus boy refilled my drink and the manager brought out our food. I didn’t catch his name but he was also very friendly.

We never had to really wait for meat. As we were about to take the meat off the grill, more was being brought to the table.  There were some stand out meats for me:

1) The Road to Seoul Pork Ribs: they were tender and had a nice heat
2) Beef Bulgogi: it had a great flavor
3) The Pork Belly Rice Cake Roll: this was my first time seeing this and I have to say I was super pleased. It honestly reminded me of mozzarella cheese
4) The Beef sirloin: they were my favorites.

Of course I enjoyed the garlic pork belly, thinly-sliced pork belly, brisket and beef tongue. On the table in front of us was a great assortment of sides and a small dish with sea salt. A sprinkle right off the grill and the cucumber salad, kimchi, rice paper and bean sprouts paired seamlessly.

The service was good but became less and less attentive as the meal progressed. I understand at first my wife and daughter did take some time to decide on their entrees. Yet I was kind of disappointed that we never received the gyoza that we ordered but luckily we were not charged for it.

I began dinner with a nice hot oolong tea. I ordered the barbecued short ribs served over grilled onions which came with miso soup and white rice. I devoured everything and enjoyed every single bite. My wife ordered the seafood hibachi and the pumpkin soup. The soup had an amazing flavor. I didn't sample her food due to my shellfish allergy.

We ended our meal with Mochi and banana tempura. Then we sat and waited, and waited but never saw our server again. Someone else eventually brought us our check.

We read the menu and decided on the Tamashii bowl combo for two. My wife is not a fan of cabbage and asked that they please take it out. It was in the bowl when it arrived at the table. I was hungry and didn't want to send it back, so I portioned her bowl minus the cabbage. My side order of chicken chashu didn't make it to the table until I asked for it.

However, once I dug into my ramen, the broth had a great flavor. The pork was super tender and had a little bit of fat, which I loved.

I didn't get fast refills on my green tea but I did get them. Both my wife and I loved the pork gyoza and fried wontons that were included with our bowl. Although I have to say that the Pork Tamashii buns stole the show! I think if you could quantify food into a state of pure enjoyment, it would be this bun. If I were to ever be on death row this bun would be my final meal. (Knock on wood I never have to make that choice.)

I bought a gift card for my wife for her birthday, the guy at the door that sold me the gift card kept trying to upsell me, saying ""how much you want $100"", I told him, no I said I was $25... He then said ok you want $50... I said, NO I want $25... He then said OK and put the gift card back in the drawer and pulled out another gift card and put the $25 on it, put it in an envelope and I left. But, when my wife opened the envelope, the card was used with $40 and 12/4/2018 written in Sharpe on it! So what happened was, when he couldn't upsell me, he swapped out the new gift card with a pre-used gift card with writhing on it of a different denomination then what I paid for because I was only getting a $25 gift card. So when my wife would go use it, they would say it was expired and it had no balance left!

I knew that was the SCAM they were trying to pull because I had already given my wife a gift card from them in the past and when she went to use it, they told her that it was expired and had no balance left on it!

So, I wasn't going to let that happen again. I went to get my money back and the guy gave me my money back and said, ""maybe next time you shouldn't be so cheap, you should get your girlfriend $50 or $100!""

I came here on an afternoon for a dinner party, the entire terrace was booked for my company, the terrace was covered with curtains and during sunset the sun was right on our face, they didn’t cover the western part of the terrace.
Food wise, I specifically told the waiter that I am vegetarian and don’t prefer cilantro nor dill, but here we go the waiter comes and shoves chicken salad and shrimps in my plate and I told him “hey, I don’t eat that” and his response was “it’s ok”. Talking about the shrimps, I saw the shrimp delivery made to the venue when I was looking for the main entrance, and to be honest the scene of shrimp delivery did not look nice nor “clean”.
Drink wise, they serve wine in a freaking black coated cups!!!! I mean who does that!!!!
Such a waste of time for me, staff are intentionally very rude in general, save your money and don’t go there.

You can schedule an appointment online at multiple locations and drop off your device at your convenience. They have same-day service for common problems, although some repairs may require next-day service.

At the Thousands Oaks location, they are very conscientious about this pandemic: They only allow 2 customers in at a time; everyone observes social distancing and there are signs posted to that effect; everyone wears mask and gloves; they sanitize your device before handing it to you; and they communicate effectively via phone, email and text about the status of your repair.

Prices are inline with national averages for major devices. They work on both Androids and iPhones and they are authorized Google and Samsung repairers (using authentic manufacturer parts).

My wife's tacos contained black beans, cheese, lettuce, tomato and avocado. Both dishes were excellent.

I guess they believe that vegetarians are naturally healthier eaters, and so they didn't even ask us if we wanted rice as a side dish. Our dishes came with a side of beans and a steamed vegetable, which were delicious, by the way. My dish came with broccoli and my wife's tacos came with peppers, zucchini and broccoli.

The beer: Tony's has a full page of their menu devoted to Caliifornia brewed, craft beers. The selection is terrific, from no fewer than 15 IPA's, to stouts, Irish-style reds, and Belgian-style blonds.They have it all, and the flavors are great. That also have hard ciders and wines.

The food:  Oh, the Food! We are vegetarians, and I love to go out and have a beer with my dinner. Unfortunately, very few pubs have food that I can eat. Tony's is not one of them.

We ordered the vegetarian bean chilli as an appetizer that we shared. It was really good! My wife makes a mean veg chilli, and this compared very favorably. She even admitted it. (Shhh!)

My wife had the vegan bahn mi sandwich, which was made with vegan pork. It's also available with real pork, and it comes with homemade potato chips. The flavors were divine. The chips stand on their own, as they were thicker than traditional chips, and not greasy at all. I wish had their recipe! My wife told me that her bahn mi was the best sandwich she has EVER had. I tasted her sandwich, and it was indeed very fresh, and flavorful. But best ever is heavy, and her beer may have been doing some of her talking. (shhh!) Don't let this diminish your chances of trying the bahn mi, as it is fantastic.

I had the Italian Stallion vegan sausage sandwich. You can get this with real meat Italian sausage, too. I added chips and a side salad for $2 extra. This was a really terrific sausage. It was very flavorful, spicy, and the texture was spot on for a sausage. I probably haven't had sausage in a restaurant more than once or twice since I became vegetarian 6 years ago. And let me be frank (no pun intended), they were not good, like, at all. The flavor was bland, the texture was mealy and blah, and they had no spice. You get the picture.

2) They replaced a faulty drum with a drum meant for 220 v hookups. Unfortunately for us, we don't have that kind of voltage running through our walls so we had to replace this as well.

3) The inverter module on this same unit is faulty again and doesn't print duplex jobs, they've already replaced it once, but won't stand by their products and replace it again citing that now the unit is out of warranty.

My order was made wrong and the girl working the drive-thru was rude and rushing us even though no one else was in line. My order was a cheese quesadilla, she asked if pico de gallo was okay with that and we said yes. That's the way I always have them, she said that's the way they're made. My friend ordered a steak quesadilla, and a western bacon cheeseburger combo as well. When we got home and I bit into my quesadilla there was no pico de gallo inside which is my favorite part of eating a quesadilla from Carl's Jr / Green burrito. We returned back to the Carl's jr. around 11:05 PM the same night and informed them of their mistake. the same girl working the drive-thru told us to pull forward to the window and they'll give us another one. The new one they made for me had too much pico de gallo in it there was onions and tomato falling out of it and hardly any cheese at all. Taste like I was eating onion tortilla sandwich. The first two bites was all pico de gallo then a little bit of cheese and the rest of the way down there was nothing. By far the worst quesadilla I've received from a Carl's jr.",California,2019-09-25 04:38:03,3.8,Carl's Jr.,468,1,Food & Beverage,425,21033.0,['Fast food restaurant' 'Hamburger restaurant'],other,2019-09-25

So far so good - I haven't gotten the tattoo yet but I have met with Misha twice for the design.
The first hour we met was free.  We talked about the type of tattoo I might want and came up with a few ideas.  I left with homework to start a pinterest board of the ideas for the next time we were to meet up.
Our second hour really was great.  The tattoo came together quickly with my ideas plus hers and she was able to sketch and color a rough draft for me during that hour.
I plopped down my deposit for our next meet up where we start the tattoo.
I love that they use google calendar for the meetings and Todd (her husband) is great about letting me know if any other times have come up in case I want to come in earlier.
They have also been really great about me needing to cancel when I've had issues with my dogs crop up.

The grilled fish chin is very delicious. The fish skin is burnt and crunchy, and the fish meat feels fish oil in every bite.

Fried oysters are very crunchy and delicious, and they are not greasy at all

The takoyaki is a good snack, and it ’s just hot and crunchy.

The main food is ramen. I ordered the tonkotsu flavor, the soup is very strong, and a little spicy to increase the appetite. The ingredients in the noodles are also very rich. !! !!
It's better if the sweetened eggs are marinated, but it's actually delicious
In fact, there is a bowl of spicy oil beef ramen, and the bowl tastes great and is highly recommended! !! The beef taste is very strong, and the soup is also delicious ~ Recommended 👍🏻

However, the brown sugar milk tea I ordered didn't taste brown sugar at all ... I don't know if he made it wrong and made ordinary milk tea ~ I just opened it to drink it when I got home and could n’t ask ...

值得一試～推薦
炸生蠔非常的鬆脆可口，完全不會油膩口

章魚燒這種小食類的也整的不錯，剛送上來熱熱脆脆的，內裏麵糊很鬆綿～好吃

主食拉麵，我點了豚骨味的，湯非常夠濃味，少許辣增加食慾～麵裡的配料也很豐富，三塊厚叉燒肉、木耳、筍絲、溏心蛋、蘿蔔絲～很值得！！
溏心蛋如果是有醃製過的會更好，不過其實都幾好味啦😋
其實還有一碗辣油牛肉拉麵，那碗味道也很棒很推薦！！牛肉味非常濃郁，湯也一樣可口～推薦👍🏻

The spicy pot tasted good, the milk pot was okay, the non-pot green curry was too light and a little tasteless!
It is worth mentioning that the portion is enough! Very good value
When the shrimp cake was delivered, the skin was very crispy, but the skin was soft after more than 10 minutes ... The taste of the shrimp inside was not fresh enough and there was no springy taste of shrimp paste ~ but it's ok, try it!
Carambola juice is great, with spicy hot and sour sweet and sour ~

不鍋值得一提是份量都很足夠！很超值👍🏻
蝦餅剛送上來的時候皮很脆，但放超過10分鐘之後皮就軟了...內陷蝦口感不夠鮮也沒有蝦泥的彈牙口感～但還行，試試無妨！

There are also delicious snacks and fried sesame balls!
There are also several sweet soups that are very spicy!
The hot soup in the hot pot is very spicy, and the cooked meat is particularly fragrant.
If you can eat mutton, it is recommended to eat lamb shoulder, rich in meat and tender.
Yellow-throated Sichuan is crispy and delicious for one minute! Yam is crispy in one minute! If you like the taste of soft powder, cook longer!
But the shrimp slip here is inferior!
I usually like spicy food. The small spicy food here is ok. It belongs to the kind of spicy imported!
Quite recommended, a little expensive.

It has vegetables like cucumber, seaweed salad, edamame, avocado and crispy onions as toppings. Or you could also choose all of available toppings to be added.
I ordered them at the counter and they were ready in 5-7 minutes.
They also have an extensive selection of Asian snacks & cookies that are often only available to purchase at an Asian grocery stores.
Even though it looks small in a to-go bowl, I felt so full after finishing it.
It’s a great inexpensive healthy meal to pick up without much planning.
A lot of people order and pick up boba teas to go as well.

Great location right by Hwy 101.
On this Friday late afternoon at 5:30 pm, the store was rather empty and no problem finding a parking in the lot close to the store.
And noticed something new which is wine tasting bar and refrigerated collection of chilled wine & beer section which I’ve never seen at other locations. This store seems larger than other ones (San Rafael & Novato).

I’d still avoid weekdays between 3:30 pm to 5:30 pm when Hwy 101 towards larkspur ferry terminal exit are incredibly congested. It’s much harder to exit and get back on freeway from Old Redwood Hwy.
Parking lot is a bit of challenge as there’s one main entrance that clogged up for cars couldn’t exit right away due to no dedicated lights for exit or enter to the complex which might be the major downside of this TJ’s location.
However, they have a lot of staffs always working every section all hours I was there. Easy to ask where about certain items or if item was out on the shelf.

Before Covid/SIP: I was able to get prompt help from staffs. They seem to have a multiple copies of popular books and some of those are only available to check out in person (instead of placing a hold).

A good size teen area where my teenagers could play card games after school.

7:30 to 7:30. Except Tuesday they close at 7 pm to do a storewide deep cleaning after closing.

Great grocery store with really good collection of fresh produce, meat/fish and good bakery too. I also like their pre-made/heat&serve section in the back near deli counter. And we also a regular buyer of prepackaged Panko crusted & Parmesan crusted Rosie’s Chicken filets. So easy and quick to prepare at home.

Always find the store very tidy and well displayed.
I see many long time employees whom I recognize over 10 years.
Many organic produce goes on sale now and then, sometimes same or a couple cents more such as swiss chard and a bunch of kale.
I think they are on sale often due to short shelf life or they get a good deal from farmers.
The breads from local companies such as Semifreddis are sold here $1-$1.50 lower than Whole Foods.
I’ve seen a couple of local restaurant chefs to pick up a few produce there too. I’ve met a couple folks from San Francisco to come here every other week to do their grocery shopping as well. I think that says a lot!
If you have to buy some high quality meat and a great selection of fresh vegetables & fruits, United Market is the best bet in San Rafael.

The puzzles were mostly locks but they did have a a few different types. There was a couple that you had to think outside the box which I think is a good challenge.

I'm under the weather, so I ordered a shrimp seafood soup and it was pretty good. Lots of 🍤; they didn't skimp and I appreciate that.

The side of noodles tasted like something we make at home. No where near enough seasoning. However, the sauce was really good.

The bread was pretty good, but my wife thought it was only okay (and she loves bread). The side salad was a joke: one tomatoe and one cucumber. Ranch was really good, but Italian dressing wasn't.

My reviews and pics have over 5,000,000 hits on Google and the vast majority of my reviews are positive. (Over 97%) During our visit we found a sectional, dining table and buffet piece. After the salesperson made several phone calls and checked on availability and confirmed all pieces were in the warehouse, we allowed credit to be run for zero interest rather than paying cash. We made the purchase for a confirmed delivery date of 2-17-2021. On 2-11-21 we received a call from the warehouse telling us our delivery would not be made on the scheduled date of 3-5-21. We have no idea where that date came from because the agreed upon delivery date written on our receipt says 2-17-21. Further, they told us the furniture would not be delivered until after the furniture became available on 5-23-2021 and it would be scheduled for the 1st week in June! That’s correct. More than 15 weeks/3.5 months late! There is no doubt they did this to HOOK us and just make the sale. We are currently on hold waiting for a manager. (On hold with warehouse and was disconnected after 20 minutes) I'm now getting in my vehicle to drive 35 minutes to the store to handle this ridiculous situation. After speaking to office manager  Jessica we canceled the deal The bottom line is either the sales person lied to us or the warehouse lied to her.  This was NOT a mistake as I see other reviews that basically say the same thing. They will say anything to grab your business and lock it up so you can't shop then you are stuck with no furniture.

The burgers here are pretty good; not the actual meat of the burger itself but they have some very tasty combinations. The Columbian was surprisingly amazing, fried banana is apparently a fantastic add to a hamburger.

My criticisms aren't really minor, but I'm going to treat them as an ""avoid these"" instead, and that would be the pork sandwich which was dry, and the wings which had the same problem but had great seasoning.

They also have really great ""poutine."" That's in quotes because by definition it isn't poutine but instead fries with mozzarella, beef, and a pesto/cilantro aioli so it's missing the requisite cheese curds and gravy. (That's just my inner Canuck talking, they're still really good).

Haven't had the drinks yet (will have to Uber there to try them) but if you like what they have in tap and are in the mood for burgers definitely give The Cut a visit, just be aware that it's still technically a bar which means the bill is not light and won't always justify what you're getting. It definitely depends on what you order: when going back I'm definitely getting another comfort burger and the poutine.

The food here is about on part with other IHOP's that I have visited but there are a few things that set this one apart for you to consider

1) It's a 24 hour location
2) The service isn't bad, but (and I don't say this often) the waiters can be unresponsive depending on what time you visit.
3) The prices of the drinks are absurd, just get water if you can help it.
4) Value on the menu varies wildly. Some of the items such as the French Toast plate isn't worth anywhere near what they're charging from either a preparation stand point or taste, while the omlettes are large and filling enough to justify their larger than average asking price.

I'd only visit if you have a coupon and are in the area, this is worth a visit at the right time.

My change in tone comes down to one drastic change in policy from previous ownership: to-go boxes.

You can purchase to-go boxes which are reusable and washable. They're a great add on to the value of a meal plan which it seems like they're also changing for the coming fall semester.

Also as I figured the food and ridiculous wait times have since the grand opening settled down, and the food quality has made a leap in quality since the past few years. I'm not sure whether this has to do with new management or a shift from completely relying on student labor to hiring more full-time staff, but they've definitely changed things for the better.

TL;DR It's college food, you can live with it. They serve you the food portioned, but you can good back as many times as you want.  Disappointing remodel.

I've been eating here for 3 years now. In that time, I have worked there for 1, and more recently seen a complete restructure of the service in the most recent academic year (2018-2019).

Let me get this bit out of the way first: it's WAS an on campus cafeteria with primarily students working the kitchen. So yes the food isn't the greatest, but it's edible and can say (believe it or not) a good chunk of the main entrees are prepared fresh. The taste is definitely a hit or miss, but despite a monthly food rotation cycle it gets old fast.

Now I all caps'd ""was"" because the year I worked there was my first year, and as I mentioned they are no longer run by Spartan Shops. As a result one of the main reasons to actually eat here being the Jamba Juice is gone. In fact a lot of things have been reorganized.

The gluten free kitchen was removed for whatever reason 2 years ago (I know a couple of friends who actually well... CAN'T EAT GLUTEN and were pretty upset when it was removed). Yes they offer gluten free options but for those of us who remembers it's not nearly as satisfying.

The recent remodel currently doesn't have the ice cream machines anymore, there's no more dedicated stand to order coffees, and the cold bar is lacking the variety it had in previous years.

But to their credit, what's left of the relocated desserts bar looks better, there's a wider variety of spices available, and they've added a coffee machine in lieu of the separate stand for ordering it.

Okay I'm stretching quite a bit, and hopefully over time they improve since it seems like they're still in the process of hiring and getting all. the stations setup but until then, it seems this new ""Spartan Dining Experience"" has turned into more of the same generic food you can find at every other CSU.

I would bring Santa Barbara, Berkeley students, even SJSU alumni and they would be impressed by the DC, because in the past years we really did have it better off than other campuses. Now? I'm not so sure.

Have a meal plan and are dissatisfied with what they  have? Assuming the policy hasn't changed with the new company, in the first few weeks you can always downgrade your plan. I'm considering it, and am hoping it's still an option.

1. At least the last 4x i have been there i haven't ordered any pastry because there is always flies or nats crawling and landing all over the food. Pastries with bugs all over doesn't do for me.
2. The outdoor seating is not cleaned very well and the areas where the seating is definitely isn't cleaned very well. Also the seating they have is a little janky, like the table shaking all the time. Basically just very cheap furniture.
3.  They have the most archaic credit card system. Literally every time you need to put your credit card in the employee has to sit and hold it so it doesn't move around. Not very sanitary when we're all trying to not touch the same things during Covid.  4. Customer service should be re-evaluated. I literally walked in two minutes before they closed, while customers were still getting drinks, and I was told ""sorry we're closed"" as I pointed out the time and showed the time to the female barista, she said,  ""oh, we just shut everything down"". The comedy of the whole situation was then she proceeded to give the other customers there two drinks.  Just pure laziness from the employee.
It's unfortunate, I live in the area I had started to go to this place more and more. There are other options but I'll keep trying them and give updates but some things could be reviewed and perhaps even made better. I'm rooting for you Hot Java.

I did this trail running, starting at the trailhead on highway 120 and finishing on the edge of North Dome. Going there I looped up to Indian Rock and continued, getting to North dome in 58 minutes.

*Footing is easy, no need for special shoes, i did it with road running shoes
*Most of it was actually under shade, down in the valley it was a hundred degrees but up there was about 85.
*only one little section of about 10 feet of slippery rock that I had to slide down on my butt
*I ran with half a liter of water but filled up my stomach before I left.
*Only needed a small CamelBak....tossed in a few granola bars.

You can do the simple hike around the lake only, which is approximately 4 miles....or you can add to this, the extension of going to Cleo's baths and that will give you a total around seven miles. And there are other options, like from the dam going down to the little river below and to the town of strawberry.
If you are new to hiking just stick with the the trail around the lake. Some of the footing is a little bit rough but you could do this trail with regular running shoes.
If you are doing the added extended part to Cleo's bath I recommend hiking/running type shoes that will protect your toes a little bit.
Be forewarned, if you are going to Cleo's baths you will have about a 1/4 mile of rock climbing, and pretty much straight up! Once you finish this section and our back down the rest continuing clockwise around the lake is very pleasant and tranquil.

As a lifelong Star Wars fan, I hugely appreciate the level of detail Disney, Disney Imagineering and Lucasfilm packed into this epic addition to Disneyland! It exceeded my expectations, and my expectations were not low.

Got up super early on a Thursday to beat the crowd (spoiler: we didn’t) in order to increase our chances of getting on the new Rise of the Resistance ride. Fortunately, at the strike of 9 am, we scored Boarding Group 24!

Both RotR and Smuggler’s Run are very fun rides. The queues themselves for either ride are also very enjoyable. I do wish they switched one queuing area on RotR that follows the First Order Star Destroyer hanger bay, it would be much more thrilling to be forced to line up by First Order officers when surrounded by a legion of Stormtroopers rather than in a hallway outside of detention cells.

Going one day ultimately I think isn’t enough time to fully appreciate the breadth of enjoyment packed into one park within Disneyland. I think I could easily spend 2 full days in Galaxy’s Edge to see literally every little detail, such as using the Datapad on the app, looking for hidden Easter eggs, riding RotR more than once to look for more details, and riding Smuggler’s Run in order to play all 3 roles (have only played as Pilot so far, but that was extremely fun!).

The only thing I yearned a little bit more for was Star Wars aliens! This outpost, being an in-universe Star Wars planet, should be teeming with exotic aliens that we’ve seen either on screen, other media or never before!

This was our first time here but are fans of their other restaurant Mr. BBQ in Fullerton.
We were pleased to see that a new option/special was added to the menu for lunch. For $16.99 you get your choice of a broth, 12oz of meat and an add on like noodles or dumplings! AYCE is still available but all guests in one party need to agree on one option or the other.
This all comes with rice and a big plate of fresh veggies! We were impressed with the quality and presentation of the vegetables and everything else tasted really good. Since the pot is divided in two you can choose two broths for the table where up to 4 people could share.
We chose the kimchi and miso broths and ordered the choice eye and chicken. Both of the broths developed nicely as the meats and and veggies were cooked. The ponzu was light and slightly seemed and the gooma (sesame) sauce was also light and tasty.
Different from many other shabu restaurants, Miss Shabu has actual gas heating so you get a more consistent temperature for your broth/soup.
Toward the end we added our noodles for the second phase of the meal. We were told about a porridge (jook) that can be made with the remaining broth, but we were too stuffed to eat any more.

Had a drink at the bar without any issues while waiting for a table.
The table took longer than quoted, but not by too much and it was a Friday evening, so somewhat expected. I think the process for having guests check back in once notified could be improved, especially when busy. There was no clear spot for us to return, so we waited in line with people adding their names to the list.
Once seated, we were greeted warmly and promptly, but when it came time to order drinks, it was clear the server was not well-versed in the available options. We asked about flavored spirits and the server just named brands, not flavors. When we asked for something listed as as an ingredient in a specialty cocktail, she said they didn’t have it. When the drink arrived, it wasn’t made correctly and the replacement took an unusually long time.
Now to the food.  I started with a side salad, which, while it looked appealing, had a pool of water at the bottom and was drenched in gloppy ranch dressing.
The pot pie I ordered was decent and the others at the table enjoyed their entrees, but they weren’t anything special.
Unfortunately, the food was not good enough to overcome the clunky service to make me want to return.",California,2020-02-01 20:06:40,4.4,Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar,1518,2,Food & Beverage,51,21992.0,['American restaurant'],Irvine,2020-02-01

We had eaten in the physical location before, but the combination of elements didn’t seem to work. I think they may have finally found the right mix with this new ownership and management.

The menu has two main options: ala carte or all you can eat. There were tiers within the AYCE option. The one bummer is your whole party must choose the same option, but it’s understandable from an operational standpoint. The prices are good and there are plenty of choices if you opt for the all you can eat.

One noticeable difference from many other shabu restaurants was the number of broth options available. They ranged from simple and slightly sweet (sukiyaki), to rich and creamy (tonkotsu) or spicy (spicy miso). There were at least 8 options to chose from!

Once you’ve chosen your broth, you select your protein(s). Our group opted for the ala carte and found the 5oz portion to be sufficient if you’re not too hungry. The angus was a decent cut but the rib eye was definitely more delicate and tender.
Finally you can choose your noodle type: classic udon, ramen, or Korean kalguksu (knife cut)noodles. I had the kalguksu and was impressed with its chewy texture. I also tasted the ramen option which I would also have enjoyed.
As the broth boils you add your vegetables and/or protein to create what will become your soup for your noodles.
The veggie mix bowl was fresh and colorful and included nice blend of cabbage, kale, carrots, etc.

I almost forgot about the dipping sauces! They were really good as well. The goma (sesame) paste was thick and savory and the ponzu was light and balanced (citrus-soy).

The service was friendly and attentive and the decor is fresh and modern. I can’t wait to go back and try more of the broth options. There are so many potential combinations!

Bravo on what hopefully will be a lasting recipe for a great shabu spot!

The spicy beef tofu soup is a relatively new addition to the menu but combines a yukgejang and spicy tofu into one dish. Instead of glass noodles, the tofu is added. The broth had a rich and smoky flavor, not too spicy or hot (temperature).

I had the dduk mandu, which was also very good, but mandu are a little bland.
This location seemed to have more menu options than the Irvine location which was appreciated.

We started with a favorite brunch beverage, a vanilla screwdriver.
For food we ordered a carrot muffin, the short rib benedict and the skillet. The muffin was moist and delicious with golden raisins throughout.
The short ribs were shredded and tender and the eggs were perfectly poached.
The skillet was full of goodness and just tasted like comfort food in a dish. It was a nice mix of flavors.

Now to the food. Everything was really quite good. On this visit I ordered the Benny Duo (an amazing option for those of us who want to try everything) with one classic and one chili verde benedict with shredded pork. I started with the latter and was immediately impressed by the combination of flavors and textures. I liked the layered tortilla base which was almost like a sope.
For the traditional benedict, the slices of ham were hearty and the hollandaise was light and creamy.
The hash brown cake on the side was a little blah compared to the benedicts, but maybe that’s intentional.
Around the rest of the table, there was a breakfast burrito, sweet potato hash and a breakfast sandwich. Everyone enjoyed their dishes.
To share, we ordered the pancake of the day. I don’t remember what they called it, but it had white chocolate chips,
chocolate and peanut butter sauce and was divine. The chips melted and got a little crunchy so it was almost like there were toffee bits in the pancake. The batter is dense but stays fluffy.
If I had one critique, it’d be about how the delay of an entree was handled. Three of our entrees arrived at the same time and the 4th didn’t. After about 10 minutes... we were told one of the elements of the dish wasn’t available and was there an alternative they could offer. That’s fine and the dish came out shortly after, but why wasn’t that asked before everything was brought out 10 minutes earlier?
Anyway, it’s not something that will not bring us back, but is something that could be improved.",California,2019-10-20 21:49:45,4.7,"Snooze, an A.M. Eatery",483,2,Food & Beverage,51,9711.0,['Breakfast restaurant' 'Bar' 'Brunch restaurant'],Orange,2019-10-20

When you first walk in the smell of kimchi immediately hits your nose. I love the stuff so it's not a problem for me. The menu isn't overwhelming and has many delicious items. We ordered quite a bit to sample everything.  The Bulgogi short ribs are excellent! Tender, juicy and flavorful! I opted for the chicken over rice hot pot which was also good.

All team is really nice and helpful at all time. I had a lot of questions prior to the weekend and they promptly answered all of  them either by email or Facebook messenger.
During the rafting our guide Ari was always nice and show a lot of knowledge and experience throughout the whole river. I'm not a very good cold resistant but they have a splash jacket  that kept me warn in the second day during the rafting.

So we decided to drive from La Canada to Cameron's seafood in Pasadena. When we arrived there we were greeted by the friendly staff of Cameron's Seafood. Our server Mayra was very accommodating, knowledgeable, and it shows she loves her job.

The New England clam chowder we ordered was one of the best clam chowder we 've had.

Ceasar salad was also good but my suggestion is to be served on a bigger plate so can be easier to manage.

Parmesan crusted sole was very satisfying, wild Alaskan salmon was so fresh and cooked to perfection. My wife changed her mind and instead of fish she ordered BBQ baby back ribs and it is worth mentioning the BBQ BABY BACK RIBS were absolutely amazing. WOW!

From 395, road climbs through barren desert and up into sparsely wooded mountains. Every time you think the road is going to crest, it just keeps going up. The actual summit comes as a surprise, and is well past the areas with the best views of the desert.

The terrain at the top is high Sierra, but unlike anything I’ve seen in Yosemite. There are expansive meadows,  tons of aspen and birch trees, a beautiful lake, and stunning views of the mountains everywhere nearby.

The trail is broken up into a few sections. At the bottom, it climbs moderately through the woods and is shaded, but there are a lot of bugs there that can be annoying. Then, it opens up and offers spectacular views of the canyon. It passes by a small waterfall – look for the path downstream to the bigger and more impressive falls – and then goes through a very nice and gentle grade under heavy tree cover. The last section starts near a large waterfall and is the only hard part, as the tree cover drops off and you’re walking on steep granite. The lakes themselves are stunning.

I did this hike on a weekday where the trail was not very crowded. Virtually everyone I passed was backpacking, which is a much better choice than doing the full trail as a day hike. The middle falls is a much better destination than the lakes if you don’t want to hike 16 miles in a single day.",California,2019-09-12 18:51:29,5.0,Canyon Creek Trailhead,35,1,Other,211,91180.0,['Hiking area' 'Tourist attraction'],other,2019-09-12

Start early in the day and prepare for lots of switchbacks; bring lots of water. The best views of the falls are on the long flat section in the middle after a short downhill - if you start this late in the day, stop here.

The trail is the most difficult in the section between the base of the falls and the summit, where it switchbacks up through a ravine. It’s steep, there’s little cover, and it goes on for a while. Get through it and you have great views at the top. The overlook atop the falls is dramatic and stunning, but you really have to lean on the railing (still worth it though).

After that, the whole northern rim opens up to you. I hiked from the top of the falls up to Yosemite Point, which offers amazing views of Half Done and the valley floor. Some people in my group went to Eagle Peak, which was long and difficult but doable. Start early enough and you can even make it to El Capitan. Or don’t.

This place is a prime example of why people complain that veganism is overrated and too expensive. I was quite disappointed by the cost to product ratio, the lack of human interaction, and definitely by the meal itself.

Atmosphere : This place is a small, limited seating establishment (a few tables and bar top stools) with an tablet ordering system (I prefer to talk to real servers) that only accepts cards. The small storefront is bright and colorful with a bee motif throughout. There is a server willing to help answer questions but he pretty much just stood and waited until after I placed my order to begin making my meal. Sort've awkward to have him hovering around when I could've just talked to him, I probably would've ordered differently.

Food : I thought I found a pretty decent deal when I ordered the Happy Bee Box which came with a made-to-order slider, frots (sweet potato fries and tots), and a ""10"" oz. shake. And while I never get sick off of food, for some reason I had a splitting headache shortly after my meal that didn't go away until much later on that night.

Slider : I knew there was gonna be a problem when I noticed the cook cut off the edges of the slider bun (I can't even get the whole bun? Such a waste of bread). But it was probably done because the smaller they make the surface area of the bun, the smaller they can make the patty. My Impossible meat patty was thinner in width AND thickness than the tomato slice on my burger! The cheese was a quarter of a typical slice and the overall flavor of the burger was nothing special. The burger was so tiny, I was still hungry after I finished my whole meal.

The Choco Bee Shake : Such a joke. I'm pretty sure that wasn't 10 ounces but I didn't get a chance to measure the cup. I cook all the time (which I should've done instead of coming here) and know what 8 oz looks like. This drink was barely that. The flavor was fine, but I wish it was a little thicker/colder.

Frots : The only good thing about my meal was the frots that tasted fresh and flavorful.

Overall : This meal was no where near worth the $13 I spent. There are much better places to get quality vegan food at a reasonable price.

The wait time in line wasn't horrible and neither was the wait for our food but if you're in a rush, you may want to pass and come back when you have more free time. I went in a Sunday around 2 and it wasn't too crowded.

My burrito was flavorful and huge! Definitely worth the money since I couldn't finish it all and took half to go. My shake was good, though I wouldn't say I'd get it again. I'd definitely try others though. The waiter recommended the cookies and cream but I chose Smores. I probably should've listened to him.

Inside and outside seating which helped since this place shares its seating with 3 other eateries. There's additional seating in an upstairs barcade but I didn't venture up there.

The atmosphere is cozy. Even for a small space, there are practically three different seating areas that give you a different feel/vibe as you dine in. There is the more public, open dining side that is bright and buzzing with chatter from the close seating while there is also a more private, secluded section when you want an intimate meal. There's even bar-style counter option perfect for solo eaters and couples. There is a single restroom that stays clean and stocked. There are cool jars of nuts and seeds that line the walls.

The food is phenomenal! Their Mealks are pricy but worth it for the amount of nuts and other nutrient dense food they pack in there. Anything with the chardonnay cheddar cheese is a winner!

It has a very unique taste that I can't find at a lot of other ramen joints. It's spicy with a hint of fermentation in it which gives the broth a much more complex taste. I highly recommend trying this one if you like fish roe.

I've previously tried their god fire and the black garlic ramen (both of which are very popular) and they all have been amazing also.

Now here's the thing, their ramen is great and all, but I feel like their secret star is the gyozas here. They are to die for. Don't make my mistake of sharing an order of 10. Make sure you tell everyone to get their own share because they are addicting. The gyoza skin is really thin while the bottom is charred and crispy. What really makes this dish though is the addition of the yuzu paste they put on the side of the gyoza soy sauce. that yuzu paste brightens up the gyoza and cuts the fattiness of the pork inside. With that combination of sauce and gyoza, I feel like I can eat multiple orders of just that alone and be satisfied.

The only thing I can fault about this place is sometimes I feel like they are a bit inconsistent with their ramen. When it's good, its really good. When they aren't on point, the ramen is just ok. Their soft boiled egg is sometimes hit or miss also. Sometimes I get a beautifully cooked soft boiled egg, while others I get a depressing hard boiled egg. Either way, this place is a must try on the list. Anything you get on the menu will probably be good.",California,2019-07-30 04:19:48,4.5,Hakata Ikkousha,587,1,Food & Beverage,151,6165.0,['Ramen restaurant' 'Asian restaurant' 'Authentic Japanese restaurant'],Costa Mesa,2019-07-30

Just follow your nose and you'll find it. The smell of smoked meats fills the air and preps you for the feast to come.

When I got there, I was told the best things on the menu was the brisket and the cornbread. Of course I had to get those, and on top of that I got a full rack of pork ribs, 1/2 chicken, baked beans, and potato salad.

Lets start with the best things on the menu. The brisket was one of the most moist and succulent pieces of bbq I've had in a long time. When paired with the bbq on the side, it compliments it perfectly with a slight acidic taste of the vinegar based bbq sauce to cut through the fat of the brisket. Next was the jalapeno cornbread, this was hands down one of the best cornbreads I've ever had. The cornbread had a crunchy top layer with a soft and succulent center. The hint of jalapeno added a bit of heat which I loved. These for sure are the things to get. Do not come here and miss out on these two items.

The next items were great, but were out shined by the brisket. The pork ribs were flavorful and had a nice rub on them, but I thought it could have used a bit more smoke flavor in them. The 1/2 chicken was very moist and the dark meat was to die for, but since it was a bbq chicken I wish there was more smokey flavor.

The sides were all fantastic and my favorite had to be the baked beans. Don't skip out on the sides here; there aren't many, but they are all done very well.

Overall I would love to come back here again and try the pulled pork. The owner, Evan, was very nice and came to check up on us and wanted to know how we liked everything. He also told us about his upcoming plans and I can't wait to see what else he has in store for this place. For being only about a month old, they have some growing to do, but I don't doubt it will only get better from here.",California,2019-07-30 03:50:45,4.7,Evan's Smokehouse BBQ,67,1,Food & Beverage,151,98041.0,['Barbecue restaurant'],other,2019-07-30

We were the only ones in the place, but I was excited to try out new Mexican food near where I live. I took my two daughters 4 and 7 because they are a very good indicator of whether this restaurant will do well for my family or not.

The service was great, the wait staff was very kind and gracious to my daughters. The food? It was absolutely fantastic.

The beans are amazing, and the Al Pastor was surprisingly good (its hard to find consistently good pastor). My kids had rice, bean and cheese burritos with grilled chicken and we're both very happy with it overall. At one point they even listed off all the restaraunts we normally go to ajd why they liked this one better haha!

The battle for best coffee on Coronado has been going on for a short while now with the likes of Bay Books, Amalo Brew, The Henry, Clayton's Bistro and Coronado coffee at the ferry landing but all of these places have been hit and miss,  with quality, never managing to produce the perfect coffee consistently.

The arrival of Parakeet Café has established a new leader in this battle and sets a clear standard for the others to follow. My experiences at other Parakeet cafe's in La Jolla and Little Italy fills me with confidence that the coffee will be consistently excellent.

I am Australian and I know that many people may not take their coffee this seriously but, for those who do, this is a welcome addition to the Coronado coffee landscape.

Originally there was just a simple box framed harbor light located at the west jetty that served from 1964 – 1996. It was replaced by a cylinder nicknamed “the water heater” which was used from 96 – 99. From 1999 until May 2002, a simple pipe structure held the light which marked the way into the harbor.
In 1998, the Santa Cruz community, under the leadership of Bill Simpkins and Jim Thoits, proposed replacing the unsightly harbor light with a lighthouse of classic design, adding a little more character to a community renowned for its characters. Fundraising efforts began in earnest, and with the contributions of many people, including a major donation from Charles Walton of Los Gatos, enough money was raised to begin construction of the new lighthouse in 2001.
The lighthouse, designed by Mark Mesiti-Miller and constructed by Devcon Construction, Inc., stands 41 ½ feet tall above the level of the west jetty, and 59 ½ feet above the mean low water mark. It weighs 350,000 pounds and is built to withstand a quarter million pounds of wave energy.
The construction began with a cylindrical inner core which houses electrical equipment and a circular staircase of forty-two steps which lead to the top of the lighthouse. Surrounding the inner core is a network of reinforcement rods, onto which “shotcrete” was blown and then hand-troweled to form the conical shape. These shotcrete walls are 4 ½ feet thick at the base. Finally, a durable weatherproof white finish was applied to the exterior of the lighthouse and a copper roofed lantern room topped it all off.
On June 9, 2002, the new harbor lighthouse was dedicated, and the signal, a green light flashing every four seconds at a focal plane of thirty-six feet, was activated. It is named the Walton Lighthouse, in honor of Mr. Charles Walton’s late brother, Derek, who served in the merchant marines and was lost at sea during World War II.",California,2021-01-27 07:53:56,4.7,Walton Lighthouse,308,1,Other,47,16509.0,['Tourist attraction'],Santa Cruz,2021-01-27

The laundry and bathrooms are clean and updated plus there's a fire pit area as well. I forgot to mention that this park is also gated! The gates close at 7:00 for added security.

You will be divided in to a group of six people. In each group, there will be two pilots, two gun-men, and two engineers. Gun-men and engineers are relatively easy to do. All you need is to focus on every button that is flashing, and press all those buttons. Gun-men have basically two main buttons to play with (to shoot), while engineers have a few more buttons (to fix the ship, but less frequent to see flashing light)
Pilots are more important (and difficult, especially the left pilot). Pilots are responsible for the stability of the spaceship. Listen to the instructions carefully and respond (drive) correctly. DO NOT frequently shake the joystick (which control direction) or you will have a very shaky flight!

This is UNACCEPTABLE, you could make a lot of people sick. The spider webs and accumulated dust in the corners of the rooms aren’t that serious.

Second time eating out since covid-19, and Midtown happened to still be open until 2pm. They open from 830am to 2pm. Outdoor seating at the moment, which was on the side of the building. There were outdoor lights hanging above the tables. The table we sat were two tables put together which made it uneven. We started with drinks first. They came out in clear plastic cups, no lid. It would have been nice if they put a lid on considering we are dining outdoors nearby a tree. So we asked for a lid, which the server brought out quickly. We settled for traditional breakfast, soc au Lait, dixieland, and dragonfairy. Dixieland and Dragonfairy had cream cheese filling. As you cut into the crepe, the cream cheese oozes out. It had too much filling. Other than that, the crepes were delicious. My son did enjoy the johnny cakes from the traditional breakfast.

First time here and the environment was very calm and friendly. We were seated on the second floor and waiter gave us time to look through the menu. She asked us if we wanted to try a mimosa, but it was too early for champagne so she gave us water. She gave us some recommendations for sweet, savory and breakfast dishes. We went with Soc Au Lait, Crepito Crepe, Beignet, Jambalaya and Crispy coated Fries. The Crepito Crepe was bland, needed flavor. The Soc Au Lait was delicious, it was sweet with the nutella filling but balanced out with the tartness of the strawberries. Jambalaya was pretty good as that was my first time, it tasted like cajun spaghetti sauce. Beignet dipped with dark chocolate sauce was good as well.

I've always had lower back pain but didn't think much of it. My husband convinced me to go to so I found Rejuvaspine Chiropractic. I was greeted by Amy at the front desk. She is very friendly. Dr. T did a great job with my treatment. Before, standing long hours at work was somewhat painful at my lower back, after several treatments, I did not feel any pain there. With continuous treatment, I started feeling better. At the end of every session, Dr. T does give you a questionnaire that needs to be brought back on the next treatment to help him know how the body is doing after an adjustment.

Everyone was good about wearing masks although social distancing in the line to get your skewers and pay was not always enforced despite the 6 feet markers on the floor, hand sanitizing station and signs around the restaurant. It would have been great to have better signs so you knew what skewers you were getting but it's understandable that with the busy lines, fresh skewers for grilling are constantly being replaced. I had wanted to get more (fake) lobster skewers second go around but got the quail eggs by accident which were good but with the family allergies potentially dangerous. You will smell like smoke afterwards and using the cardboard 'fans' beware of sending embers at your neighbors sharing the grill.

There were also balut and boiled peanuts present so just as a warning for people with allergies, there may be cross contamination with certain allergens.

From driving up to the building, a massive structure out in the middle of open space, it was obvious that this would be a beast. And situated right near SAC airport, for some of their outgoing freight, this is a gigantic fulfillment center. They handle incoming, storage and outgoing customer orders.

While an average supermarket is 30,000 sq ft., or Costco's breaking 145,000 sq ft, this Amazon building is over 900,000 sq ft.

It's fascinating how it combines old warehouse technology with new.  For example, you might see the longest conveyor belt carrying goods from one side to another, while the 4 floors were lit by fluorescent light-- old school.  But then you see armies of robots moving towers of merchandise all over special wired floors, without the machines banging into each other.

Yeah, the people all work ridiculously hard. How'd you think you were receiving goods to your home same day or next day?

As I climbed to the top of the Culver steps——j/k lol

As I drove, latte in hand, the winding road to the top, I was reminded of SF's Twin Peaks. This is LA's version of the magnificent midcity mountaintop perch.

The view from Griffith Observatory is a real showstopper, especially at night. But if you want to take in the full sweep of the LA Basin, head to Baldwin Hills.

A powerful rainstorm had just come through, scrubbing the atmosphere clean.  The snowcapped San Gabriels stretched from 10,000ft Mt Baldy in the east, providing a dramatic backdrop for the LA skyline and the Hollywood Hills/Santa Monica mountains which run 30 miles west from Hollywood into the Pacific Ocean at Point Dume.

From here you can trace the entire 16-mile length of Wilshire Blvd, running like a river of commercial development from DTLA through Westlake, Koreatown, the Miracle Mile, Beverly Hills, Century City, Westwood, all the way to Santa Monica. The view extends 30 miles out to sea, including the arc of coastline from Malibu's Pt Dume south to Palos Verdes and Catalina.

One caveat: I got lucky, visiting this scenic overlook on one of the clearest days of 2019. You may not be as fortunate. For starters, there's only snow on the mountains in winter, and not always this much. Then there's that famous smog. It's better than it used to be. When you look up the sky is always blue. But get a few hundred feet off the ground and the view across the city can often be marred by a layer of gray-brown smudge. You have been warned.

Also, the park closes at sunset. It's a fantastic spot to watch that spectacle. But if you want the twinkling lights of nighttime Los Angeles, head to the Observatory.",California,2019-12-31 23:49:24,4.8,Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook,3524,1,Nature & Outdoor,158,1839.0,['Park' 'Tourist attraction'],Culver City,2019-12-31

I took the manager aside as we left and let him know none of us would be back. He was apologetic—but not surprised. That tells me that they just don't care. And that's a much bigger problem than one server having a bad day.

I walked down to Farfalla Trattoria for my lunch break. The hostess was welcoming and asked if I wanted to be seated inside or outside. It was a beautiful day, so I sat outside. A gentleman came over shortly with a basket of bread and a delicious tomato-based spread of sorts. I looked at the menu while I waited for a server. About 25 minutes passed, so I went inside to make my presence known. One of the servers asked if I needed something, so I told her I had been seated for 25 minutes and no one had come to my table. She apologized immediately and said she thought I had already cashed out with a different server. I asked if I could place my order to go because I needed to go back to work. She said of course and took my order.

She came back to the table and apologized again and explained I was in another server's section. And then said she put a rush on the food order and threw in a free dessert for my trouble. My food was ready not long after. I did tip her.

To review the actual food, delicious! There is always an off day, so I don't think that's a reason for a bad review. I would go back because the atmosphere was lovely and the food great.

This is why I hate buying a car because everybody always try to take advantage of you. Seriously trying to charge $4000 more for a used vehicle than I can buy the exact same vehicle brand new from a bunch of different dealerships?

2019 Nissan Frontier S King Cab Retail Price =$24,430

Price of same new vehicle with rebates =$20,910

Price from Lithia for USED vehicle last week $18,795, told them I would come buy and price online changed to $26,995!!!

Asked them to reevaluate, they said they would honor $18,795, asked for email stating this and they said back firm to $26,995!!!

I really tried to give them a few chances here to be fair but all they really wanted to do at the end of the day is try to stick its me for thousands of dollars like I don't know how to use a simple calculator and like I don't know how to tell when you've added huge dollar amounts to a price.

We had an employee get together today and thought it would be a good idea to use a local company to cater in some food. We wanted to feed 4 people and our options from here works are by a taco bar that would feed either 5 people or 10 people. We chose to purchase the taco bar that would feed 10 people so that we would be sure to let everybody have enough to eat.

We didn't use crazy portions per taco but we didn't even have enough food to feed 4 people 1 serving leaving us having to go and buy more food.

I called and spoke with the manager on duty expressing my disappointments in the size of the portions in the amount of food that we got for spending $160 at which point he asked me what he could do to make me happy and I asked him to tell me what he could do to make me happy to which he had no answer and told me that he made the food right.

After selecting my vehicle and being connected to a local dealership, I was given an emailed offer for a specific vehicle and a specific price.

I email back-and-forth with the salesman who sent me the offer and asked him to not only double check but to triple check the numbers as I didn't want to waste my time driving to the dealership for an offer that was not legitimate. I made sure to ask them if there were any discounts being applied to the price that I could perhaps find out that I didn't qualify for upon arriving just to make sure that there were no trickery or Tom foolery involved

After being 100% clear in the exact vehicle that I wanted versus the price that they offered for a specific vehicle on their lot and asking them to double check and triple check the offer that they gave me, which was a fair offer, they ensured me that their offer was correct and that I could come in and purchased the vehicle without any problems.

I arrived at the dealership and sat down to fill out all of the paperwork to buy the vehicle at which point the salesman came back with the usual car salesman tactics of ""I must have made a mistake somewhere because we can't give you the car at that price""

This is one of those dealerships that when you walk out of, you have to wipe the slime off of you because that's how greasy they are. I'm a business man and they completely wasted my time by dragging me into their place and then wouldn't honor their deal. I had no problem securing and even better deal from Nissan in Roseville.

Very frustrated and disappointed that I went out of my way to ensure that we were on the same page, was guaranteed that we were all on the same page, and then upon arrival they wanted to raise the price a few thousand dollars. After speaking with a manager and explaining the whole thing to him and showing him all of my emails back-and-forth with the sales associate you could completely tell that this was part of their plan there was no remorse in having wasted my time this was just an effort to get me in the door in the hopes that since I was there I would buy irrespective of the price.

He kept trying to give me all kinds of excuses as to why they couldn't offer it and explained to me that the mistakes had something to do with him having applied the rebate from a different vehicle which was higher to my vehicle on accidents. I reminded him that I was a 100% clear in having already asked him several times if this was correct and have written communication back-and-forth of him telling me that yes this is a 100% correct that he scrubbed the numbers that he double checked and triple checked and that there would be no issues. If this wasn't a deliberate trick to just get me in there to buy then the only other thing that it could be is people who are inept at their job .
